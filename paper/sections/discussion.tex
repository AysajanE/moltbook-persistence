\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

This section interprets the empirical patterns in \Cref{sec:results} through the
model framework in \Cref{sec:model}, focusing on implications for collective
agent behavior, platform design, and identification scope.

\subsection{Interpreting Minute-Scale Reply Decay}
\label{sec:discussion:halflife}

The primary Moltbook estimate is a sub-minute reply-kernel half-life, accompanied
by heavy censoring. Together, these results indicate a bursty regime: when direct
replies occur, they tend to occur quickly; most at-risk parent comments receive no
observed direct reply during the observation window.

This pattern is consistent with finite context retention, rapid task switching in
high-volume feeds, and weak return-to-thread memory support. The Reddit baseline,
by contrast, shows hour-scale reply-kernel half-life under the same estimator.
Matched-subset half-life estimates preserve this large timing gap, but the matched
design is intentionally coarse and overlap-restricted, so it is used as
secondary contextual evidence rather than a core causal estimate.

\subsection{Structural Signatures of Limited Persistence}
\label{sec:discussion:structure}

Shallow, root-heavy trees are consistent with low effective non-root reproduction
in the branching interpretation (\cref{sec:model:branching}). When
\(\mu\) is small, deep paths become exponentially unlikely, so thread geometry is
dominated by first-layer responses rather than sustained chains. Low reciprocity
and modest re-entry further support a broadcast-dominant interaction pattern.

\subsection{Implications for AI Agent Coordination}
\label{sec:discussion:coordination}

These dynamics matter for multi-step coordination tasks. If engagement decays on
minute timescales and repeated participation is limited, projects requiring
extended deliberation or multi-day follow-through are difficult to sustain
without explicit coordination scaffolds. Updated heterogeneity analyses suggest
meaningful differences by account status in observed reply incidence, but
follower-bin patterns remain non-monotonic and sparse in upper bins, so stronger
hub claims require longer windows and richer controls.

\subsection{Design Implications}
\label{sec:discussion:design}

The measured dynamics point to practical interventions that can be tested in
future platform studies: memory scaffolding for active threads, summary-based
re-entry support, feed prioritization of threads with prior participation, and
incentive structures that reward sustained engagement rather than raw posting
volume. Structured coordination interfaces (for example, commitments, milestones,
and scheduled check-ins) are especially relevant if the default interaction
regime remains fast-response-or-silence.

\subsection{Broader Implications}
\label{sec:discussion:broader}

Interaction half-life is a portable metric for comparing collective persistence
across agent communities and model generations. The current cross-platform
results add overlap-region context beyond raw platform contrasts via
deterministic matching, but are not a primary causal identification strategy.
Stronger causal interpretation still requires richer exposure controls and more
granular semantic alignment. Because Moltbook is rapidly evolving, longitudinal
tracking is necessary to determine whether the persistence gap narrows as agents,
moderation, and interface design mature.

\subsection{Scope Conditions}
\label{sec:discussion:scope}

Scope and identification constraints are consolidated in
\Cref{sec:limitations}. In particular, the cross-platform matched analysis is
interpreted as overlap-only contextual comparison rather than a platform-wide
causal estimate.

\subsection{Connection to Model Predictions}
\label{sec:discussion:model}

The empirical results align with the core model predictions by jointly testing
reply-kernel timescale, depth-tail behavior, branching concentration,
reciprocity/re-entry, and periodic signatures at the hypothesized heartbeat
frequency. Together, these checks provide an internally consistent first-pass
assessment of whether horizon-limited cascade dynamics describe early
agent-network discourse, while clarifying where richer formulations
(\Cref{sec:model:extensions}) are needed for the next stage of inference.
