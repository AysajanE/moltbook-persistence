\section{Data and Code Availability}
\label{sec:reproducibility}

Code and derived reproducibility artifacts for this manuscript version are
archived on Zenodo \citep{eziz2026zenodoejorrepro}. The archive contains the
analysis scripts, manuscript-facing figures/tables, run manifests, checksum
manifests, and sanitized instance-level derived tables.

The Moltbook source dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face
\citep{simulamet2026observatoryarchive}. Raw Reddit exports are not
redistributed because of platform terms; only IDs/anonymized derivatives and
aggregate outputs are shared.

\paragraph{Reproducibility recipe (canonical runs).}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create the Python 3.11 environment with \texttt{make install}.
\item Use the pinned curated inputs documented in the Zenodo manifest and
repository \texttt{README.md}.
\item Re-run the three analysis pipelines with seed \texttt{20260206}.
\item Verify run manifests for Moltbook-only, Reddit-only, and matched runs.
\item Confirm manuscript artifact linkage with
\texttt{MANUSCRIPT\_ARTIFACT\_PROVENANCE.csv}.
\item Validate release integrity with \texttt{SHA256SUMS.txt}.
\item Use repository docs for environment and operational details not needed in
this manuscript appendix.
\end{itemize}
