\section{Reproducibility and Data Access}
\label{sec:reproducibility}

This appendix summarizes data access, computational environment, and replication
scope for the analyses reported in this manuscript.

\subsection{Data and Code Access}

The primary Moltbook dataset is publicly available at
\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SimulaMet/moltbook-observatory-archive}.
Reddit raw data are not redistributed because of platform terms; the study relies on
curated run-scoped derivatives and aggregate outputs that support replication of the
reported tables and figures. The analysis code and manuscript source are publicly
available in the project repository:
\url{https://github.com/AysajanE/moltbook-persistence}.

\subsection{Computational Environment and Replication Scope}

Canonical analyses for this revision were rerun on macOS (arm64) with Python 3.11.14
and fixed random seed 20260206. Core dependencies include NumPy, pandas, SciPy,
lifelines, Matplotlib, and seaborn (versions recorded in the repository environment
specification). The empirical claims in this manuscript are based on deterministic
pipelines with fixed preprocessing rules, thread-level bootstrap uncertainty
quantification, and AR(1)-calibrated periodicity tests. Full command-level execution
instructions are provided in repository documentation; this appendix intentionally
summarizes provenance at manuscript level rather than enumerating file paths.

\subsection{Archival Plan}

Upon publication, we will archive the repository in a DOI-minted release,
tag the paper-consistent revision, and provide checksums for downloaded upstream
artifacts where licensing permits redistribution metadata.
