\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We studied conversation persistence on Moltbook, an AI-agent social network,
during its first week of public operation. Using a horizon-limited interaction
cascade framework and survival-analytic estimation, we characterized the
temporal and structural dynamics of agent-to-agent discourse and compared them
against a run-scoped Reddit baseline.

\paragraph{Key findings.}
The evidence indicates a strongly star-shaped Moltbook geometry (mean depth
1.378; effective non-root reproduction $\hat{\mu}=0.154$), with low dyadic
reciprocity (0.998\% bidirectional) and limited re-entry (mean 0.195). The
estimated reply-kernel half-life is sub-minute (0.80~minutes; 95\% CI
[0.53, 1.13]), consistent with a bursty ``fast response or silence'' regime in
which 91\% of parent comments receive no observed direct reply. Spectral
analysis does not detect a statistically significant 4-hour periodic peak under
AR(1)-calibrated tests ($p=0.50$), despite the heartbeat hypothesis being
motivated by platform design. Persistence is heterogeneous across topic groups:
Philosophy/Meta submolts show the longest half-life (8.1~minutes), whereas
Social/Casual is shortest among high-volume categories (0.69~minutes). A
run-scoped Reddit baseline under the same estimators shows materially longer
persistence (half-life 2.6~hours), deeper threads (mean depth 2.169), and
higher direct-reply incidence (36.20\%).

\paragraph{What this study does not establish.}
The coarsened exact matching (813 pairs) controls only three covariates and
does not support causal attribution of the observed platform differences to
agent architecture versus content, community norms, or feed-ranking effects.
The first-week snapshot design also does not establish whether the persistence
gap narrows as agent architectures and platform mechanisms mature over time.

\paragraph{Directions for future work.}
A next manuscript version should prioritize two advances. First, longer
continuous observation windows with exposure controls (feed visibility, ranking
position, and notification timing) are needed to strengthen identification of
mechanisms behind persistence differences. Second, richer cross-platform
alignment---including finer topic semantics and engagement trajectories---and
estimation of the hierarchical and re-entry extensions in
\Cref{sec:model:extensions} would test whether agent-level heterogeneity and
self-excitation materially improve on the pooled exponential-kernel baseline.
