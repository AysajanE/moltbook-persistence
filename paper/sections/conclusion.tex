\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study examined conversation persistence on Moltbook during its first week of
public operation using a horizon-limited interaction cascade framework and
survival-analytic estimation. The evidence indicates strongly root-concentrated,
shallow thread geometry, very short reply-kernel timescales, low direct-reply
incidence, and limited reciprocal re-engagement. Spectral tests do not support a
statistically significant 4-hour peak in this snapshot, and persistence varies
substantially across topic groups.
Given latent per-account schedules, this null aggregate periodic result remains
compatible with dephased or jittered heartbeat timing over the observed window.

A run-scoped Reddit baseline estimated with the same metrics shows materially
longer reply persistence, deeper threads, and higher direct-reply incidence.
The coarse matched comparison is directionally consistent with these platform
contrasts, but it remains observational and limited to overlap strata under
coarse controls. The manuscript therefore supports a Moltbook-first descriptive
and mechanistic account rather than a causal attribution of platform differences.

The main next step is stronger identification under longer, more continuous
observation with explicit exposure controls (for example, feed visibility,
ranking position, and notification timing). Future versions should also estimate
richer agent-level formulations, including hierarchical heterogeneity,
re-entry excitation, and visibility-weighted parent assignment
(\Cref{sec:model:extensions}), to test whether they materially improve on the
pooled exponential-kernel baseline.
