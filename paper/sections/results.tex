\subsection{Conversation Geometry on Moltbook}
\label{sec:results:geometry}

\subsubsection{Depth Distribution}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/depth_distribution_moltbook.png}
\caption{Distribution of maximum thread depth \(D_j\) over Moltbook threads with at least
one comment (\(N=34{,}730\)).}
\label{fig:depth-distribution}
\end{figure}

Moltbook conversation trees are shallow (\cref{fig:depth-distribution}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean depth: 1.378 (95\% bootstrap CI: [1.372, 1.383]),
    \item Median depth: 1,
    \item Proportion reaching depth 5+: 0.0058\% (95\% bootstrap CI: [0.0000\%, 0.0144\%]),
    \item Proportion reaching depth 10+: 0.0000\%.
\end{itemize}

Fitting the depth-tail relation \(\Prob(D_j \geq k) \leq \mu^k\) gives
\(\hat{\mu}=0.154\), consistent with a strongly subcritical branching regime.

\subsubsection{Branching Factor by Depth}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/branching_by_depth_moltbook.png}
\caption{Mean direct-children count by node depth.}
\label{fig:branching-by-depth}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:branching-by-depth} shows strong root concentration. The root receives 5.57 direct
replies on average, while depth-1 and depth-2 nodes receive 0.153 and 0.008 direct replies,
respectively. This is the expected star-shaped pattern under rapid branching decay.
Applying the root-special branching approximation (\cref{prop:thread-size}) with $\mu_0 \approx 5.57$ (root)
and $\hat{\mu} \approx 0.154$ (non-root) gives $\E[N_j] \approx \mu_0/(1-\hat{\mu}) \approx 6.6$
comments per thread, closely matching the observed mean of 6.43 (\cref{tab:descriptive}).

\subsubsection{Reciprocity and Re-Entry}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/reentry_distribution_moltbook.png}
\caption{Distribution of thread-level re-entry rate \(\mathrm{RE}_j\).}
\label{fig:reentry-distribution}
\end{figure}

Dyadic reciprocity is low: 1,621 of 162,430 dyads are bidirectional (0.998\%).
Reciprocal chains are short (median chain length 2; mean 2.09). Thread-level re-entry is also
limited (\cref{fig:reentry-distribution}), with mean 0.195 and median 0.167.

\subsection{Interaction Half-Life}
\label{sec:results:halflife}

\subsubsection{Overall Estimate}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/survival_curve_moltbook.png}
\caption{Kaplan--Meier survival curve and fitted exponential model for time to first direct
reply.}
\label{fig:survival-curve}
\end{figure}

Using one survival unit per parent comment, the primary analysis sample includes 199,000
comments (17,915 events; 181,085 right-censored), after excluding parents posted within 4
hours of the dataset end to reduce boundary censoring bias.
The fitted exponential model yields:
\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta} &= 52.209 \text{ hr}^{-1} \quad \text{(95\% bootstrap CI: [36.852, 78.524])}, \\
\hat{h} &= \frac{\ln 2}{\hat{\beta}} = 0.0133 \text{ hr}
\quad \text{(95\% bootstrap CI: [0.0088, 0.0188])}.
\end{align*}

In minutes, this corresponds to 0.80 minutes (95\% CI: [0.53, 1.13]).
Without the 4-hour boundary exclusion, the estimate is similar (0.0115 hr).

This estimate should be interpreted as a \emph{kernel decay timescale}
(see \cref{rem:estimand}), not as a median thread lifetime. The combination
of a sub-minute half-life with a 91\% censoring fraction (181,085 of 199,000
parent comments receive no observed direct reply) describes a bursty two-regime
process: a small fraction of parent comments attract rapid direct replies
concentrated in the first seconds to minutes, while the large majority receive
no direct reply at all during the observation window. The Moltbook reply
process is thus better characterized as ``fast response or silence'' than as
a gradual decay of engagement.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Reply probability and timing decomposition (primary survival samples).}
\label{tab:reply-dynamics}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrrrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Sample} & \textbf{Parents} & \textbf{Observed reply \%} & \textbf{Cond. median (min)} & \textbf{Half-life (hr)} & \textbf{Implied eventual \% (model)} \\
\midrule
Moltbook (overall) & 199,000 & 9.00 & 0.076 & 0.0133 & 9.28 \\
Builder/Technical & 7,696 & 1.73 & 1.918 & 0.0529 & 1.73 \\
Philosophy/Meta & 5,429 & 1.86 & 1.844 & 0.1346 & 1.87 \\
Social/Casual & 168,407 & 10.29 & 0.075 & 0.0115 & 10.67 \\
Creative & 366 & 1.91 & 0.483 & 0.0076 & 1.91 \\
Spam/Low-Signal & 2,218 & 0.90 & 1.315 & 0.0226 & 0.90 \\
Other & 14,884 & 2.13 & 1.484 & 0.0535 & 2.14 \\
Reddit (overall) & 9,547 & 36.20 & 39.317 & 2.6066 & 38.70 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\Cref{tab:reply-dynamics} separates event incidence from timing. On Moltbook, only
9.00\% of parent comments receive any direct reply in-window, versus 36.20\% on the
Reddit baseline. Conditional on receiving a reply, Moltbook replies arrive within seconds
to minutes (overall median 0.076 minutes), while Reddit conditional timing is much slower
(39.3 minutes median). The implied eventual percentages are model-diagnostic quantities
under the exponential-kernel fit, not direct empirical estimands.

\paragraph{Model check: conditional median vs.\ half-life.}
Under the fitted exponential-kernel model in the low-reply-probability regime
($\hat{\alpha}/\hat{\beta} \approx 0.097$), the conditional distribution of the first
reply time---given a reply occurs---is approximately $\mathrm{Exponential}(\hat{\beta})$,
whose median equals the kernel half-life ($\approx 0.80$~minutes).
The empirical conditional median is 0.076~minutes, roughly $10\times$ smaller.
This gap indicates that the single-parameter exponential kernel captures the overall
timescale of hazard decay but understates early-time concentration:
observed replies arrive even faster than the fitted exponential predicts.
The Weibull shape parameter $\hat{\gamma} = 0.1115 \ll 1$ (\Cref{sec:results:halflife})
confirms this departure---a decreasing hazard that is steeply concentrated in the first
seconds.  Accordingly, the half-life reported throughout should be interpreted as a
\emph{coarse exponential-kernel timescale}, not as a precise predictor of conditional
reply timing.

\subsubsection{Weibull Shape Parameter}

The Weibull model gives shape \(\hat{\gamma}=0.1115\) (95\% bootstrap CI:
[0.1110, 0.1122]), far below 1. This indicates strong early-time hazard concentration and
substantial deviation from a constant-hazard assumption.

\subsubsection{Stratification by Submolt Category}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Interaction half-life by submolt category in the primary survival sample.}
\label{tab:halflife-by-submolt}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Threads} & \textbf{Comments} & \textbf{Half-life (hr)} & \textbf{95\% CI} \\
\midrule
Philosophy/Meta & 1,310 & 5,429 & 0.1346 & [0.0481, 0.2502] \\
Other & 3,882 & 14,884 & 0.0535 & [0.0343, 0.0771] \\
Builder/Technical & 1,853 & 7,696 & 0.0529 & [0.0339, 0.0733] \\
Spam/Low-Signal & 569 & 2,218 & 0.0226 & [0.0115, 0.0323] \\
Social/Casual & 23,747 & 168,407 & 0.0115 & [0.0067, 0.0171] \\
Creative & 111 & 366 & 0.0076 & [0.0035, 0.0152] \\
\midrule
Overall & 31,472 & 199,000 & 0.0133 & [0.0088, 0.0188] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Half-life varies across categories in this first-pass estimate. Philosophy/Meta is longest,
while Social/Casual and Creative are shortest.

\subsubsection{Agent Heterogeneity}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Agent-level heterogeneity in reply incidence and timing (Moltbook primary sample).}
\label{tab:agent-heterogeneity}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Group family} & \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Parents} & \textbf{Observed reply \%} & \textbf{Half-life (min)} \\
\midrule
\texttt{is\_claimed} & Claimed & 18,367 & 18.19 & 0.48 \\
\texttt{is\_claimed} & Unclaimed & 180,633 & 8.07 & 0.87 \\
\texttt{follower\_count} & 0 & 176,689 & 8.41 & 0.85 \\
\texttt{follower\_count} & 1--9 & 21,167 & 14.37 & 0.52 \\
\texttt{follower\_count} & 10+ & 238 & 1.68 & 1.85 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/agent_group_reply_dynamics_moltbook.png}
\caption{Moltbook heterogeneity by claim status and follower-count bins.}
\label{fig:agent-group-heterogeneity}
\end{figure}

\Cref{tab:agent-heterogeneity} and \cref{fig:agent-group-heterogeneity} show that claimed
accounts have materially higher observed direct-reply incidence (18.19\% vs.\ 8.07\%) and
shorter first-reply half-life (0.48 vs.\ 0.87 minutes) than unclaimed accounts. The
follower-bin split is non-monotonic: \(1\text{--}9\) followers is highest-incidence in this
snapshot, while the 10+ bin is sparse (\(n=238\) parent comments), so that estimate is
interpreted cautiously.

\subsection{Periodicity Detection}
\label{sec:results:periodicity}

\subsubsection{Spectral Analysis}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/psd_moltbook.png}
\caption{Power spectral density of aggregate comment activity in the longest contiguous
comment-time segment.}
\label{fig:psd}
\end{figure}

Because the canonical timeline contains a 41.72-hour gap, periodicity is estimated on the
longest contiguous segment (2026-02-02 04:20:50Z to 2026-02-04 19:51:53Z; 63.52 hours).

At the 4-hour target frequency (\(f=0.25\) hr\(^{-1}\)), the peak-to-background ratio is
6.41. However, AR(1)-calibrated tests do not support significance
(Fisher's \(g=0.0937\), \(p=0.6855\); target-frequency power \(p=0.501\)).
The dominant spectral component is at 0.15625 hr\(^{-1}\) (period 6.4 hours), not 4 hours.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/periodicity_bin_robustness_moltbook.png}
\caption{Bin-width robustness for Moltbook periodicity tests (5, 15, 30 minutes).}
\label{fig:periodicity-bin-robustness}
\end{figure}

The non-significant 4-hour conclusion is stable across bin widths on the same contiguous
segment: target-frequency AR(1)-calibrated \(p\)-values are 0.508 (5 min), 0.501 (15 min),
and 0.556 (30 min). The dominant period shifts from 5.33 to 8.0 hours across these binning
choices, but none imply a significant 4-hour peak.

\subsubsection{Agent-Level Autocorrelation}

Among 1,076 agents with at least 10 comments in the contiguous segment, mean lag-4-hour
autocorrelation in 15-minute binned activity is 0.1106
(95\% bootstrap CI: [0.0997, 0.1221]).

\subsection{Reddit Full-Scale Baseline}
\label{sec:results:reddit-full-scale}

The Reddit baseline run (\texttt{attempt\_scaled\_20260206-142651Z}) contains 1,772
submissions, 9,878 comments, and 1,104 threads with at least one comment. Comment timestamps
span 2026-01-31T00:03:20Z to 2026-02-04T23:59:34Z.

\subsubsection{Geometry, Branching, and Re-Entry}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/depth_distribution_reddit.png}
\caption{Distribution of maximum thread depth \(D_j\) for the Reddit run
\texttt{attempt\_scaled\_20260206-142651Z}.}
\label{fig:depth-distribution-reddit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/branching_by_depth_reddit.png}
\caption{Mean direct-children count by node depth for the Reddit run.}
\label{fig:branching-by-depth-reddit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/reentry_distribution_reddit.png}
\caption{Distribution of thread-level re-entry rate \(\mathrm{RE}_j\) for the Reddit run.}
\label{fig:reentry-distribution-reddit}
\end{figure}

Conversation geometry is materially deeper than a pure star regime but still root-concentrated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean maximum depth per thread: 2.169; median: 1,
    \item \(\Prob(D \ge 5)=11.32\%\) and \(\Prob(D \ge 10)=1.54\%\),
    \item Mean branching factor at depth 0: 4.305; at depth 1: 0.446,
    \item Re-entry rate mean: 0.0938; median: 0.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{First-Reply Half-Life}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/survival_curve_reddit.png}
\caption{Kaplan--Meier survival curve and fitted exponential model for the Reddit run.}
\label{fig:survival-curve-reddit}
\end{figure}

The primary survival sample includes 9,547 parent comments (3,456 events; 6,091 censored),
after excluding 329 parents within the 4-hour right-boundary window. The exponential estimate
gives a first-reply half-life of 2.6066 hours (95\% CI: [2.2933, 2.9539]). A no-boundary
sensitivity estimate is similar at 2.5755 hours. The observed direct-reply probability is
36.20\% (3,456/9,547), with implied eventual probability 38.70\% under the fitted
exponential model.

\subsubsection{Periodicity}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/psd_reddit.png}
\caption{Power spectral density of aggregate Reddit comment activity in the run window.}
\label{fig:psd-reddit}
\end{figure}

Spectral analysis finds a dominant frequency of 0.03125 hr\(^{-1}\), corresponding to a
32-hour period. For the 4-hour target frequency test, AR(1)-calibrated target-power
\(p=0.6845\). Fisher's \(g\) test yields \(p<0.0005\) (0/2000 exceedances), indicating
detectable periodic structure at some frequency but not specifically at 4 hours under this
test.

\subsubsection{Run-Scoped Caveats}

Two upstream caveats recorded in run manifests are carried into interpretation: 1,570 comments
were dropped during curation due to missing submission IDs, and the request log includes 2
non-200/error responses. These caveats do not invalidate the run, but they bound claims to the
curated, observed corpus.

\subsection{Cross-Platform Comparison}
\label{sec:results:comparison}

We executed coarse exact matching on the pinned Moltbook and Reddit feature
runs described in \Cref{sec:methods:comparison}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/cross_platform_matched_sample_flow.png}
\caption{Matched-sample flow for the coarse cross-platform design.}
\label{fig:cross-platform-flow}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/cross_platform_matched_balance_love.png}
\caption{Covariate balance before and after coarse exact matching.}
\label{fig:cross-platform-balance}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Sample flow.} The input includes 34,730 Moltbook threads and 1,104 Reddit threads.
After requiring matching covariates, all threads remained eligible. Exact overlap strata on
\((\texttt{topic\_coarse},\texttt{hour},\texttt{early-bin})\) retained 2,641 Moltbook threads
and 888 Reddit threads across 118 shared strata. Deterministic 1:1 matching yielded 813 pairs
(813 threads per platform; \cref{fig:cross-platform-flow}).

\textbf{Balance diagnostics.} The maximum absolute SMD across monitored covariates decreased
from 3.886 pre-match to 0.052 post-match. By construction, matched support aligns on the
coarsened matching factors after pairing; some factor levels are absent post-match and therefore
have undefined level-wise diagnostics (\cref{fig:cross-platform-balance}).

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Paired cross-platform outcome differences in the matched sample
(Moltbook minus Reddit).}
\label{tab:cross-platform-paired-effects}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{\(n\) pairs} & \textbf{Moltbook mean} & \textbf{Reddit mean} & \textbf{Mean diff [95\% CI]} \\
\midrule
Comments per thread & 813 & 2.337 & 10.041 & \(-7.704\) [\(-9.432\), \(-6.060\)] \\
Max depth & 813 & 1.021 & 2.212 & \(-1.191\) [\(-1.343\), \(-1.039\)] \\
Unique participants & 813 & 2.042 & 7.050 & \(-5.009\) [\(-6.099\), \(-4.001\)] \\
Thread duration (hours) & 813 & 0.051 & 8.656 & \(-8.606\) [\(-9.997\), \(-7.338\)] \\
Re-entry rate & 792 & 0.056 & 0.096 & \(-0.040\) [\(-0.054\), \(-0.027\)] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All paired differences are negative for Moltbook relative to Reddit under this coarse design.
Wilcoxon signed-rank \(p\)-values are \(1.43\times10^{-49}\) (comments),
\(5.16\times10^{-54}\) (depth), \(7.62\times10^{-45}\) (unique participants),
\(6.50\times10^{-41}\) (duration), and \(4.77\times10^{-9}\) (re-entry).

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Paired mean differences with bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals
(Moltbook minus Reddit).}
\label{fig:cross-platform-effects}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Matched-subset first-reply half-life.} Restricting survival units to matched threads,
the primary-sample half-life is 0.0628 hours on Moltbook (3.77 minutes; 95\% CI:
[1.19, 7.06] minutes; \(n=1{,}841\) parent comments, 22 events) and 2.4448 hours on Reddit
(95\% CI: [2.1298, 2.7926] hours; \(n=7{,}979\), 2,882 events). These half-life values are
derived from matched-thread subsets but are estimated at platform level, not as paired
thread-level survival effects.

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
\label{sec:results:summary}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Shallow structure}: Moltbook threads are strongly star-shaped
    (mean depth 1.378; median depth 1; \(\hat{\mu}=0.154\)).
    \item \textbf{Low reciprocity}: Bidirectional dyads are rare (0.998\%), and reciprocal
    chains are short.
    \item \textbf{Limited re-entry}: Thread-level re-entry is modest
    (mean 0.195; median 0.167).
    \item \textbf{Very short first-reply half-life}: Estimated half-life is 0.0133 hours
    (0.80 minutes; 95\% CI: [0.53, 1.13] minutes) in the primary survival specification.
    \item \textbf{Two-regime reply dynamics}: Moltbook observed direct-reply incidence is
    9.00\% versus 36.20\% on Reddit; conditional timing differs by orders of magnitude.
    \item \textbf{No statistically significant 4-hour spectral peak}: Although power at
    0.25 hr\(^{-1}\) is elevated relative to local background, AR(1)-based tests are not
    significant across 5/15/30-minute bin-width checks.
    \item \textbf{Coarse matched cross-platform sample}: Exact matching on coarse topic,
    UTC posting hour, and first-30-minute engagement bins produced 813 1:1 pairs across
    118 strata. Maximum absolute SMD decreased from 3.886 to 0.052.
    \item \textbf{Coarse matched differences}: In matched pairs, Moltbook threads are lower
    on comments (\(-7.704\)), depth (\(-1.191\)), unique participants (\(-5.009\)),
    duration (\(-8.606\) hours), and re-entry (\(-0.040\)); all Wilcoxon tests are
    statistically significant.
    \item \textbf{Matched-subset half-life contrast}: On matched-thread subsets, Moltbook
    first-reply half-life is 0.0628 hours (3.77 minutes; 95\% CI: [1.19, 7.06] minutes)
    versus 2.4448 hours for Reddit (95\% CI: [2.1298, 2.7926]).
    \item \textbf{Reddit periodicity finding}: Dominant periodic component is 32 hours
    (0.03125 hr\(^{-1}\)); the 4-hour target-frequency test is not significant
    (\(p=0.6845\)), while Fisher's \(g\) reports \(p<0.0005\) (0/2000 exceedances).
\end{enumerate}
