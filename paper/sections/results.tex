\label{sec:results}

We report Moltbook-only results from curated snapshot
\texttt{snapshot\_20260204-234429Z}, with all estimates generated by
\texttt{analysis/06\_moltbook\_only\_analysis.py}
(run ID \texttt{run\_20260206-145240Z}).

\subsection{Conversation Geometry on Moltbook}
\label{sec:results:geometry}

\subsubsection{Depth Distribution}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/depth_distribution_moltbook.png}
\caption{Distribution of maximum thread depth \(D_j\) over Moltbook threads with at least
one comment (\(N=34{,}730\)).}
\label{fig:depth-distribution}
\end{figure}

Moltbook conversation trees are shallow (\cref{fig:depth-distribution}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean depth: 1.378 (95\% bootstrap CI: [1.372, 1.383]),
    \item Median depth: 1,
    \item Proportion reaching depth 5+: 0.0058\% (95\% bootstrap CI: [0.0000\%, 0.0144\%]),
    \item Proportion reaching depth 10+: 0.0000\%.
\end{itemize}

Fitting the depth-tail relation \(\Prob(D_j \geq k) \leq \mu^k\) gives
\(\hat{\mu}=0.154\), consistent with a strongly subcritical branching regime.

\subsubsection{Branching Factor by Depth}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/branching_by_depth_moltbook.png}
\caption{Mean direct-children count by node depth.}
\label{fig:branching-by-depth}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:branching-by-depth} shows strong root concentration. The root receives 5.57 direct
replies on average, while depth-1 and depth-2 nodes receive 0.153 and 0.008 direct replies,
respectively. This is the expected star-shaped pattern under rapid branching decay.

\subsubsection{Reciprocity and Re-Entry}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/reentry_distribution_moltbook.png}
\caption{Distribution of thread-level re-entry rate \(\mathrm{RE}_j\).}
\label{fig:reentry-distribution}
\end{figure}

Dyadic reciprocity is low: 1,621 of 162,430 dyads are bidirectional (0.998\%).
Reciprocal chains are short (median chain length 2; mean 2.09). Thread-level re-entry is also
limited (\cref{fig:reentry-distribution}), with mean 0.195 and median 0.167.

\subsection{Interaction Half-Life}
\label{sec:results:halflife}

\subsubsection{Overall Estimate}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/survival_curve_moltbook.png}
\caption{Kaplan--Meier survival curve and fitted exponential model for time to first direct
reply.}
\label{fig:survival-curve}
\end{figure}

Using one survival unit per parent comment, the primary analysis sample includes 199,000
comments (17,915 events; 181,085 right-censored), after excluding parents posted within 4
hours of the dataset end to reduce boundary censoring bias.
The fitted exponential model yields:
\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta} &= 52.209 \text{ hr}^{-1} \quad \text{(95\% bootstrap CI: [36.852, 78.524])}, \\
\hat{h} &= \frac{\ln 2}{\hat{\beta}} = 0.0133 \text{ hr}
\quad \text{(95\% bootstrap CI: [0.0088, 0.0188])}.
\end{align*}

In minutes, this corresponds to 0.80 minutes (95\% CI: [0.53, 1.13]).
The estimate is very short because observed direct replies are concentrated in the first
seconds to minutes, while most parent comments receive no direct reply in-window.
Without the 4-hour boundary exclusion, the estimate is similar (0.0115 hr).

\subsubsection{Weibull Shape Parameter}

The Weibull model gives shape \(\hat{\gamma}=0.1115\) (95\% bootstrap CI:
[0.1110, 0.1122]), far below 1. This indicates strong early-time hazard concentration and
substantial deviation from a constant-hazard assumption.

\subsubsection{Stratification by Submolt Category}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Interaction half-life by submolt category in the primary survival sample.}
\label{tab:halflife-by-submolt}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Threads} & \textbf{Comments} & \textbf{Half-life (hr)} & \textbf{95\% CI} \\
\midrule
Philosophy/Meta & 1,310 & 5,429 & 0.1346 & [0.0481, 0.2502] \\
Other & 3,882 & 14,884 & 0.0535 & [0.0343, 0.0771] \\
Builder/Technical & 1,853 & 7,696 & 0.0529 & [0.0339, 0.0733] \\
Spam/Low-Signal & 569 & 2,218 & 0.0226 & [0.0115, 0.0323] \\
Social/Casual & 23,747 & 168,407 & 0.0115 & [0.0067, 0.0171] \\
Creative & 111 & 366 & 0.0076 & [0.0035, 0.0152] \\
\midrule
Overall & 31,472 & 199,000 & 0.0133 & [0.0088, 0.0188] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Half-life varies across categories in this first-pass estimate. Philosophy/Meta is longest,
while Social/Casual and Creative are shortest.

\subsubsection{Agent Heterogeneity}

For a simple heterogeneity check, we compare pooled half-life estimates for comments authored
by agents in the bottom vs.\ top karma quartile among observed karma values. Because both
quartile cutoffs are 0 in this snapshot (high mass at zero karma), this split is weakly
informative. Estimated half-lives are similar: 0.0140 hr (bottom quartile) vs.\ 0.0133 hr
(top quartile).

\subsection{Periodicity Detection}
\label{sec:results:periodicity}

\subsubsection{Spectral Analysis}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/psd_moltbook.png}
\caption{Power spectral density of aggregate comment activity in the longest contiguous
comment-time segment.}
\label{fig:psd}
\end{figure}

Because the canonical timeline contains a 41.72-hour gap, periodicity is estimated on the
longest contiguous segment (2026-02-02 04:20:50Z to 2026-02-04 19:51:53Z; 63.52 hours).

At the 4-hour target frequency (\(f=0.25\) hr\(^{-1}\)), the peak-to-background ratio is
6.41. However, AR(1)-calibrated tests do not support significance
(Fisher's \(g=0.0937\), \(p=0.697\); target-frequency power \(p=0.4905\)).
The dominant spectral component is at 0.15625 hr\(^{-1}\) (period 6.4 hours), not 4 hours.

\subsubsection{Agent-Level Autocorrelation}

Among 1,076 agents with at least 10 comments in the contiguous segment, mean lag-4-hour
autocorrelation in 15-minute binned activity is 0.1106
(95\% bootstrap CI: [0.0997, 0.1221]).

\subsection{Cross-Platform Comparison}
\label{sec:results:comparison}

Cross-platform Reddit comparisons are not included in this analysis pass. The Moltbook-only
results above establish the baseline needed for the next stage of matched comparative
inference.

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
\label{sec:results:summary}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Shallow structure}: Moltbook threads are strongly star-shaped
    (mean depth 1.378; median depth 1; \(\hat{\mu}=0.154\)).
    \item \textbf{Low reciprocity}: Bidirectional dyads are rare (0.998\%), and reciprocal
    chains are short.
    \item \textbf{Limited re-entry}: Thread-level re-entry is modest
    (mean 0.195; median 0.167).
    \item \textbf{Very short first-reply half-life}: Estimated half-life is 0.0133 hours
    (0.80 minutes; 95\% CI: [0.53, 1.13] minutes) in the primary survival specification.
    \item \textbf{No statistically significant 4-hour spectral peak}: Although power at
    0.25 hr\(^{-1}\) is elevated relative to local background, AR(1)-based tests are not
    significant.
\end{enumerate}
