\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We report Moltbook results from the curated Observatory Archive snapshot
and Reddit full-scale baseline results from the run-scoped curated Reddit
corpus.
Reproducibility details are provided in \Cref{sec:reproducibility}.
The presentation proceeds in five steps: we first characterize Moltbook
conversation geometry, then decompose reply dynamics into incidence and timing
through the half-life analysis, then test periodic structure at the
hypothesized 4-hour frequency, then report the Reddit full-scale baseline, and
finally present a coarse matched cross-platform comparison as secondary
contextual evidence on overlap support.

\subsection{Conversation Geometry on Moltbook}
\label{sec:results:geometry}

\subsubsection{Depth Distribution}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/depth_distribution_moltbook.png}
\caption{Distribution of maximum thread depth \(D_j\) over Moltbook threads with at least
one comment (\(N=34{,}730\)).}
\label{fig:depth-distribution}
\end{figure}

Moltbook conversation trees are shallow (\cref{fig:depth-distribution}): mean maximum depth is 1.38
(95\% bootstrap CI: [1.37, 1.38]), median maximum depth is 1, the proportion reaching depth 5+
is 0.006\% (95\% bootstrap CI: [0.000\%, 0.014\%]), and the proportion reaching depth 10+
is 0.000\%.

Fitting a geometric log-tail slope to empirical \(\Prob(D_j \geq k)\) for
\(k\ge2\), motivated by the bound \(\Prob(D_j \geq k) \leq \mu^k\), gives
\(\hat{\mu}=0.154\). We report \(\hat{\mu}\) as an effective tail-slope
parameter (descriptive), indicating rapid depth-tail decay consistent with a
strongly subcritical branching regime.

\subsubsection{Branching Factor by Depth}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/branching_by_depth_moltbook.png}
\caption{Mean direct-children count by node depth.}
\label{fig:branching-by-depth}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:branching-by-depth} shows strong root concentration. The root receives 5.57 direct
replies on average, while depth-1 and depth-2 nodes receive 0.153 and 0.008 direct replies,
respectively. This is the expected star-shaped pattern under rapid branching decay.
Applying the root-special branching approximation (\cref{prop:thread-size}) with $\mu_0 \approx 5.57$ (root)
and descriptive \(\hat{\mu} \approx 0.154\) (non-root tail-slope proxy) gives the
heuristic expectation \(\E[N_j] \approx \mu_0/(1-\hat{\mu}) \approx 6.6\)
comments per thread, closely matching the observed mean of 6.43 (\cref{tab:descriptive}).

\subsubsection{Reciprocity and Re-Entry}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/reentry_distribution_moltbook.png}
\caption{Distribution of thread-level re-entry rate \(\mathrm{RE}_j\).}
\label{fig:reentry-distribution}
\end{figure}

Dyadic reciprocity is low: 1,621 of 162,430 dyads are bidirectional (0.998\%).
Reciprocal chains are short (median chain length 2; mean 2.09). Thread-level re-entry is also
limited (\cref{fig:reentry-distribution}), with mean 0.195 and median 0.167.
Missing-author-ID sensitivity is small: restricting to threads with complete
commenter IDs (34,476 of 34,730 threads; 99.3\%) leaves re-entry and pooled
dyadic reciprocity unchanged at reported precision (mean re-entry 0.20;
pooled reciprocity 1,621/162,430 \(=1.0\%\)). The only visible shift is
mean unique participants per thread, from 4.57 to 4.60.

\subsection{Interaction Half-Life}
\label{sec:results:halflife}

\subsubsection{Overall Estimate and Two-Regime Finding}
\label{sec:results:two-regime}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/reply_hazard_moltbook.png}
\caption{Empirical binned reply hazard versus parent age (first 10 minutes, log scale), with
fitted exponential-kernel hazard overlay.}
\label{fig:reply-hazard-moltbook}
\end{figure}

Using one survival unit per at-risk parent comment, the primary analysis sample includes 199,000
comments (17,915 events; 181,085 right-censored), after excluding parents posted within 4
hours of the dataset end to reduce boundary censoring bias.
The fitted exponential-kernel hazard model yields:
\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta} &= 52.2 \text{ hr}^{-1} \quad \text{(95\% bootstrap CI: [36.9, 78.5])}, \\
\hat{h} &= \frac{\ln 2}{\hat{\beta}} = 0.013 \text{ hr}
\quad \text{(95\% bootstrap CI: [0.009, 0.019])}.
\end{align*}

In minutes, this corresponds to 0.80 minutes (95\% CI: [0.53, 1.13]).
Without the 4-hour boundary exclusion, the estimate is similar (0.011 hr).

This estimate should be interpreted as a \emph{kernel decay timescale}
(see \cref{rem:estimand}), not as a median thread lifetime. The combination
of a sub-minute half-life with a 91\% censoring fraction (181,085 of 199,000
at-risk parent comments receive no observed direct reply) describes a bursty
two-regime process: a small fraction of at-risk parent comments attract rapid direct replies
concentrated in the first seconds to minutes, while the large majority receive
no direct reply at all during the observation window. The Moltbook reply
process is thus better characterized as ``fast response or silence'' than as
a gradual decay of engagement.

\end{table}

\textbf{Two-regime finding (incidence--timing split).}
\textbf{Result: a low-incidence / ultra-fast conditional response regime.}
\Cref{tab:reply-dynamics} separates event incidence from timing. On Moltbook, only
9.0\% of at-risk parent comments receive any direct reply in-window, versus 36.2\% on the
Reddit baseline. Conditional on receiving a reply, Moltbook replies arrive within seconds
to minutes (overall median 0.076~minutes, i.e., $\approx$4.6~seconds), while
Reddit conditional timing is much slower (39.3~minutes median). The implied eventual percentages are model-diagnostic quantities
under the exponential-kernel fit, not direct empirical estimands.

Model check (conditional median vs.\ half-life):
Under the fitted exponential-kernel model in the low-reply-probability regime
($\hat{\alpha}/\hat{\beta} \approx 0.097 \ll 1$), the conditional distribution
of the first reply time---given a reply occurs---is approximately
$\mathrm{Exponential}(\hat{\beta})$ (rare-event approximation), whose median
equals the kernel half-life ($\approx 0.80$~minutes); the exact conditional
density is given in \Cref{eq:appendix-conditional-density}.
The empirical conditional median is 0.076~minutes, roughly $10\times$ smaller.
This gap indicates that the single-parameter exponential kernel captures the overall
timescale of hazard decay but understates early-time concentration:
observed replies arrive even faster than the fitted exponential predicts.
The Weibull shape parameter $\hat{\gamma} = 0.112 \ll 1$ (\Cref{sec:results:halflife})
and the empirical hazard profile in \Cref{fig:reply-hazard-moltbook} confirm this
departure---a decreasing hazard that is steeply concentrated in the first seconds.
Accordingly, the half-life reported throughout should be interpreted as a
\emph{coarse exponential-kernel timescale}, not as a precise predictor of conditional
reply timing.

\subsubsection{Weibull Shape Parameter}

The Weibull model gives shape \(\hat{\gamma}=0.112\) (95\% bootstrap CI:
[0.111, 0.112]), far below 1. This indicates strong early-time hazard concentration and
substantial departure from the fitted exponential decaying hazard
\(\lambda(s)=\alpha e^{-\beta s}\) (not from a constant-hazard baseline), with additional excess concentration at very
small \(s\).

\subsubsection{Stratification by Submolt Category}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Interaction half-life by submolt category in the primary survival sample.}
\label{tab:halflife-by-submolt}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Threads} & \textbf{Comments} & \textbf{Half-life (hr)} & \textbf{95\% CI} \\
\midrule
Philosophy/Meta & 1,310 & 5,429 & 0.135 & [0.048, 0.250] \\
Other & 3,882 & 14,884 & 0.054 & [0.034, 0.077] \\
Builder/Technical & 1,853 & 7,696 & 0.053 & [0.034, 0.073] \\
Spam/Low-Signal & 569 & 2,218 & 0.023 & [0.011, 0.032] \\
Social/Casual & 23,747 & 168,407 & 0.011 & [0.007, 0.017] \\

\midrule
Overall & 31,472 & 199,000 & 0.013 & [0.009, 0.019] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Half-life varies across categories in this first-pass estimate. Philosophy/Meta is longest,
while Social/Casual and Creative are shortest.

\subsubsection{Agent Heterogeneity}

\caption{Agent-level heterogeneity in reply incidence and timing (Moltbook primary sample).}
\label{tab:agent-heterogeneity}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llrrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Group family} & \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Parents} & \textbf{Observed reply \%} & \textbf{Half-life (min)} \\
\midrule
\texttt{is\_claimed} & Claimed & 18,367 & 18.2 & 0.48 \\
\texttt{is\_claimed} & Unclaimed & 180,633 & 8.1 & 0.87 \\
\texttt{follower\_count} & 0 & 176,689 & 8.4 & 0.85 \\
\texttt{follower\_count} & 1--9 & 21,167 & 14.4 & 0.52 \\
\texttt{follower\_count} & 10+ & 238 & 1.7 & 1.85 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/agent_group_reply_dynamics_moltbook.png}
\caption{Moltbook heterogeneity by claim status and follower-count bins.}
\label{fig:agent-group-heterogeneity}
\end{figure}

\Cref{tab:agent-heterogeneity} and \cref{fig:agent-group-heterogeneity} show that claimed
accounts have materially higher observed direct-reply incidence (18.2\% vs.\ 8.1\%) and
shorter reply-kernel half-life (0.48 vs.\ 0.87 minutes) than unclaimed accounts. The
follower-bin split is non-monotonic: \(1\text{--}9\) followers is highest-incidence in this
snapshot, while the 10+ bin is sparse (\(n=238\) at-risk parent comments), so that estimate is
interpreted cautiously.

\subsection{Periodicity Detection}
\label{sec:results:periodicity}

\subsubsection{Spectral Analysis}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/psd_moltbook.png}
\caption{Power spectral density of aggregate comment activity in the longest contiguous
comment-time segment.}
\label{fig:psd}
\end{figure}

Because the canonical timeline contains a 41.7-hour gap, periodicity is estimated on the
longest contiguous segment (2026-02-02 04:20:50Z to 2026-02-04 19:51:53Z; 63.5 hours).

At the 4-hour target frequency (\(f=0.25\) hr\(^{-1}\)), the peak-to-background ratio is
6.41, defined as \(P(f_\tau^\star)/\widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{bg}}\), where
\(P(f_\tau^\star)\) is Welch power at the nearest frequency bin to
\(0.25\) hr\(^{-1}\) and \(\widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{bg}}\) is the median Welch
power across positive frequencies excluding the
\(\pm 0.03\) hr\(^{-1}\) neighborhood around \(f_\tau^\star\). However, AR(1)-calibrated tests do not support significance
(Fisher's \(g=0.094\), \(p=0.686\); target-frequency power \(p=0.501\)).
The dominant spectral component is at 0.156 hr\(^{-1}\) (period 6.4 hours), not 4 hours.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/periodicity_bin_robustness_moltbook.png}
\caption{Bin-width robustness for Moltbook periodicity tests (5, 15, 30 minutes).}
\label{fig:periodicity-bin-robustness}
\end{figure}

The non-significant 4-hour conclusion is stable across bin widths on the same contiguous
segment: target-frequency AR(1)-calibrated \(p\)-values are 0.508 (5 min), 0.501 (15 min),
and 0.556 (30 min). The dominant period shifts from 5.33 to 8.0 hours across these binning
choices, but none imply a significant 4-hour peak.

\subsubsection{Agent-Level Autocorrelation}

Among 1,076 agents with at least 10 comments in the contiguous segment, mean lag-4-hour
autocorrelation in 15-minute binned activity is 0.111
(95\% bootstrap CI: [0.100, 0.122]).
This does not contradict the non-significant aggregate 4-hour spectral peak:
lag-4-hour autocorrelation reflects short-lag persistence and does not uniquely identify
a 4-hour periodic driver, and it is consistent with weak or dephased heartbeat-like
behavior that is not strong enough to produce a significant aggregate spectral peak
in this short contiguous window.

\subsection{Reddit Full-Scale Baseline}
\label{sec:results:reddit-full-scale}

The Reddit baseline corpus (\Cref{sec:data:reddit}) contains 1,772
submissions, 9,878 comments, and 1,104 threads with at least one comment. Comment timestamps
span 2026-01-31T00:03:20Z to 2026-02-04T23:59:34Z.

\subsubsection{Geometry, Branching, and Re-Entry}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/depth_distribution_reddit.png}
\caption{Distribution of maximum thread depth \(D_j\) for the Reddit baseline corpus.}
\label{fig:depth-distribution-reddit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/branching_by_depth_reddit.png}
\caption{Mean direct-children count by node depth for the Reddit run.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/reentry_distribution_reddit.png}
\caption{Distribution of thread-level re-entry rate \(\mathrm{RE}_j\) for the Reddit run.}
\label{fig:reentry-distribution-reddit}
\end{figure}

Conversation geometry is materially deeper than a pure star regime but still root-concentrated.
Mean maximum depth per thread is 2.17 (median maximum depth 1),
\(\Prob(D \ge 5)=11.32\%\),
\(\Prob(D \ge 10)=1.54\%\), mean branching factor is 4.31 at depth 0 and 0.45 at depth 1,
and re-entry has mean 0.094 and median 0.

\subsubsection{Reply-Kernel Half-Life}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/survival_curve_reddit.png}
\caption{Kaplan--Meier survival curve and fitted exponential-kernel hazard model for the Reddit run.}
\label{fig:survival-curve-reddit}
\end{figure}

The primary survival sample includes 9,547 at-risk parent comments (3,456 events; 6,091 censored),
after excluding 329 parents within the 4-hour right-boundary window. The exponential estimate
gives a reply-kernel half-life of 2.61 hours (95\% CI: [2.29, 2.95]). A no-boundary
sensitivity estimate is similar at 2.58 hours. The observed direct-reply probability is
36.20\% (3,456/9,547), with implied eventual probability 38.70\% under the fitted
exponential-kernel hazard model.

\subsubsection{Periodicity}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/psd_reddit.png}
\caption{Power spectral density of aggregate Reddit comment activity in the run window.}
\label{fig:psd-reddit}
\end{figure}

Spectral analysis finds a dominant frequency of 0.031 hr\(^{-1}\), corresponding to a
32-hour period. For the 4-hour target frequency test, AR(1)-calibrated target-power
\(p=0.685\). Fisher's \(g\) test yields \(p<0.001\) (0/2000 exceedances), indicating
detectable periodic structure at some frequency but not specifically at 4 hours under this
test.

\subsubsection{Run-Scoped Caveats}

Two upstream caveats from collection and curation are carried into interpretation:
1,570 comments were dropped during curation due to missing submission IDs, and
the request log includes 2 non-200/error responses. These caveats do not
invalidate the run, but they bound claims to the curated, observed corpus.

\subsection{Cross-Platform Comparison}
\label{sec:results:comparison}

This section is secondary contextual evidence on overlap support rather than a
core causal identification pillar. Under deterministic coarse matching
(\Cref{sec:methods:comparison}), 813 pairs are formed, and all paired outcome
differences in \Cref{tab:cross-platform-paired-effects} are negative for
Moltbook relative to Reddit; all two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests reject at
conventional levels (\(p < 10^{-8}\)). The re-entry contrast remains negative
in matched support even though the full-sample descriptive contrast is positive.
Sample-flow accounting, balance diagnostics, paired-effect visualization, and
matched-subset half-life details are reported in
\Cref{sec:appendix:comparison-details,sec:appendix:balance,sec:appendix:match-halflife}.

\begin{table}[t]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
\label{sec:results:summary}

Overall, Moltbook threads are strongly star-shaped (mean maximum depth 1.38, median
maximum depth 1, effective tail-slope parameter \(\hat{\mu}=0.154\)), with rare bidirectional dyads (0.998\%) and
modest re-entry (mean 0.195; median 0.167). The primary Moltbook survival
specification yields a very short reply-kernel half-life of 0.013 hours
(0.80 minutes; 95\% CI: [0.53, 1.13] minutes), alongside a two-regime reply
pattern in which observed direct-reply incidence is 9.00\% on Moltbook versus
36.20\% on Reddit and conditional timing differs by orders of magnitude.
Although power at the 4-hour target frequency is elevated relative to
background (median power outside the \(\pm0.03\) hr\(^{-1}\) target neighborhood),
AR(1)-based tests remain non-significant across 5/15/30-minute
binning choices.

\subsubsection{H1a Readout (Short Hazard Half-Life)}
\label{sec:results:h1a}
H1a is supported by the minute-scale estimate (\(\hat h=0.013\) hours) and by
the labeled two-regime incidence--timing split in
\Cref{sec:results:two-regime}.

\subsubsection{H1b Readout (4-Hour Periodicity)}
\label{sec:results:h1b}
H1b is not detected in this snapshot under AR(1)-calibrated target-frequency
tests (\(p=0.501\) at 15-minute bins; 0.508 and 0.556 at 5- and 30-minute
bins).

In the coarse matched cross-platform design, Moltbook remains lower on comments,
depth, unique participants, duration, and re-entry in matched support
(\Cref{tab:cross-platform-paired-effects}); these are secondary contextual
overlap-region estimates rather than platform-wide causal effects. Detailed
matching diagnostics and matched-subset half-life estimates are provided in
\Cref{sec:appendix:comparison-details,sec:appendix:balance,sec:appendix:match-halflife}.
