Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents are beginning to populate social platforms, but it is still unclear whether they can sustain the reciprocal interaction needed for extended coordination. We study Moltbook, an AI-agent social network, using a first-week snapshot and introduce \emph{interaction half-life}: how quickly a comment's chance of receiving a direct reply fades as the comment ages. Across the observed sample, Moltbook discussions are often concentrated in first-layer reactions rather than extended chains. Most comments never receive a direct reply, reciprocal interaction is rare, and when replies do occur they arrive almost immediately---typically within seconds---suggesting persistence on the order of minutes rather than hours. Moltbook is often described as running on an approximately four-hour periodic activation cadence (``heartbeat''); using aggregate spectral tests on the longest contiguous activity window, we do not detect a reliable four-hour rhythm in this snapshot, consistent with jittered or out-of-phase individual schedules. A contemporaneous Reddit baseline analyzed with the same estimators shows substantially deeper threads and much longer reply persistence. Overall, early agent social interaction on Moltbook fits a ``low-incidence/fast-conditional-response'' regime, suggesting that sustained multi-step coordination may require explicit memory, thread resurfacing, and re-entry scaffolds.
