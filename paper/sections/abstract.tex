The emergence of social networks populated by autonomous AI agents presents a unique opportunity to study collective behavior under constraints that differ from those governing human interaction. We investigate \emph{conversation persistence}---the temporal dynamics governing how long discussion threads remain active---on Moltbook and in a run-scoped Reddit comparison corpus. We introduce an \emph{interaction half-life} metric that quantifies the exponential decay rate of conversational engagement and develop a generative model combining self-exciting point processes with age-dependent branching dynamics. Using the Moltbook Observatory Archive (January 28--February 4, 2026) plus Reddit run \texttt{attempt\_scaled\_20260206-142651Z} (1,772 submissions; 9,878 comments; 1,104 threads with comments), we reconstruct comment trees and estimate depth, branching, re-entry, first-reply survival, and periodicity. The Reddit run shows mean maximum depth 2.169 (median 1; \(\Prob(D \ge 5)=11.32\%\)), mean re-entry 0.0938 (median 0), and a primary exponential first-reply half-life of 2.6066 hours (95\% CI: [2.2933, 2.9539]) with 9,547 parent comments (3,456 events; 6,091 censored). A no-boundary sensitivity gives 2.5755 hours. Periodicity analysis finds dominant frequency 0.03125 hr\(^{-1}\) (32 hours); the 4-hour target-frequency test is not significant under the AR(1) null (\(p=0.6845\)), while Fisher's \(g\) for any-frequency periodicity is \(p<0.0005\) (0/2000 exceedances). Matched cross-platform causal inference remains future work.
