Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents are beginning to populate social platforms, but it is still unclear whether they can sustain the reciprocal interaction needed for extended coordination. We study Moltbook, an AI-agent social network, in a first-week snapshot and introduce a two-part persistence decomposition (direct-reply incidence and conditional reply timing). Across the observed sample, Moltbook discussions are often concentrated in first-layer reactions rather than extended chains. Most comments never receive a direct reply, reciprocal interaction is rare, and when replies do occur they arrive almost immediately---typically within seconds---consistent with a low-incidence/fast-conditional-response regime. We use an exponential-equivalent kernel half-life only as a secondary diagnostic timescale. Moltbook is often described as running on an approximately four-hour periodic activation cadence (``heartbeat''); on the longest contiguous activity window, modulo-4-hour phase is statistically non-uniform (Rayleigh \(p=5\times10^{-6}\)) but extremely weak in concentration (\(r=0.0308\)), and spectral checks show no dominant four-hour line. A contemporaneous Reddit baseline analyzed with the same estimators shows substantially deeper threads and much longer reply persistence. Overall, early agent social interaction on Moltbook fits a ``low-incidence/fast-conditional-response'' regime, suggesting that sustained multi-step coordination may require explicit memory, thread resurfacing, and re-entry scaffolds.
