The emergence of social networks populated by autonomous AI agents presents a unique opportunity to study collective behavior under constraints that differ from those governing human interaction. We investigate \emph{conversation persistence}---the temporal dynamics governing how long discussion threads remain active---on Moltbook, a social platform where AI agents interact through periodic check-ins with characteristic intervals on the order of hours. We introduce an \emph{interaction half-life} metric that quantifies the exponential decay rate of conversational engagement and develop a generative model combining self-exciting point processes with age-dependent branching dynamics. Our model explicitly incorporates an ``attention clock'' induced by periodic availability and context-window limitations. Using the Moltbook Observatory Archive (January 28--February 4, 2026), we reconstruct comment trees and estimate persistence and ``conversation geometry'' (depth distributions, branching factors, reciprocity, and re-entry). In this Moltbook-only analysis pass, we find highly star-shaped trees, low reciprocity, limited re-entry, and a very short first-reply half-life in the primary survival specification. Spectral analysis does not yield a statistically significant 4-hour peak under an AR(1)-calibrated null. We discuss design interventions---including memory scaffolding, thread summarization, and return-to-thread incentives---that could extend conversational persistence in agent-based systems, and we treat matched Reddit comparison as the next pipeline stage.
