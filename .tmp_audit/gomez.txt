ABSTRACT
We analyze the structure and evolution of discussion cas-
cades in four popular websites: Slashdot, Barrapunto, Me-
neame and Wikipedia. Despite the big heterogeneities be-
tween these sites, a preferential attachment (PA) model wit h
bias to the root can capture the temporal evolution of the ob-
served trees and many of their statistical properties, name ly,
probability distributions of the branching factors (degre es),
subtree sizes and certain correlations. The parameters of
the model are learned eﬃciently using a novel maximum
likelihood estimation scheme for PA and provide a ﬁgura-
tive interpretation about the communication habits and the
resulting discussion cascades on the four diﬀerent website s.

1. INTRODUCTION
Human communication patterns on the Internet are char-
acterized by transient responses to social events. Example s
of such phenomena are the discussion threads generated in
news aggregators, the propagation of massively circulated
Internet chain letters, or the synthesis of articles in coll abo-
rative web-based spaces such as Wikipedia.
These responses can be regarded as tree-like cascades of
activity generated from an underlying social network. Typ-
ically, a trigger event, or a small set of initiators, genera te a

chain reaction which may catch the attention of other users
who end up participating in the cascade (see Figure 1 for
examples) and attract even more users. Since these cas-
cades of comments are a direct consequence of the informa-
tion ﬂow in a social system, understanding the mechanisms
and patterns which govern them plays a fundamental role
in contexts like spreading of technological innovations [2 3],
diﬀusion of news and opinion [11, 20], social inﬂuence [1] or
collective problem-solving [15].
Although information cascades have been extensively an-
alyzed for particular domains, such as blogs [11, 20], chain
letters [21], Flickr [6], Twitter [17] or page diﬀusion on Fa ce-
book [24], the cascades under consideration in those studie s
rarely involve elaborated discussions or complex intercha nge
of opinions: generally, a small piece of information is just
forwarded from an individual to its direct neighbors. To the
best of our knowledge, with the exception of [16], no previ-
ous work exists on modeling the evolution and structure of
long discussion-based cascades.
Here, as in [16], we consider several websites where the
associated (discussion) cascades contain high level of int er-
action. We analyze for the ﬁrst time the cascades of the
popular news aggregator Slashdot, Barrapunto (a Spanish
version of Slashdot) and Meneame (a Spanish Digg-clone)
and the English Wikipedia. As the reader may notice, these
datasets are quite heterogeneous. For instance, although
posts from both Slashdot and Meneame correspond to popu-
lar news which rely on broadcasted events, Slashdot contain s
rich and very extensive comments, which are less frequent in
Meneame. The cascades found in Wikipedia, on the other
hand, represent collaborative eﬀort towards a well deﬁned
goal: produce a free, reliable article.
In this study we address the following questions: what
are the statistical patterns that determine the structure o f
such cascades and their evolution? Can these patterns be
largely determined regardless of semantic information us-
ing a simple parametric model? Can the parameterization
corresponding to a given website provide a global character -
ization for it?
We ﬁrst provide a global analysis of the cascade behavior
in the four mentioned websites. Among other results, we ﬁnd
that typically, the sizes of the cascades have a clear deﬁned
scale, which seems to contradict the recent results of [16].
Our analysis also highlights the importance of repetitive
user participation in relation to other types of cascades an d
their impact on the entire social network. We also present a
growth model for discussion cascades which is validated in
the four datasets. Our approach is based on a simple model

of preferential attachment (PA) [2], where new contributio ns
in the cascade tree are linked to existing contributions wit h
a probability which depends on their popularity (degree).
Two key ingredients characterize our approach: First, we
account for a certain bias favoring the root, or event ini-
tiator. In this way, we are able to capture the diﬀerent
processes governing the global (direct reactions) and the l o-
calized responses of the system. Second, we use a likelihood
method particularly developed for this study which allows
an eﬃcient estimation of the model parameters which con-
siders the entire generative model. The method is applicable
not only for the data considered here but for a more general
class of growing graphs. Here we are only interested on the
stochastic process which generates the cascade. We do not
model network dynamics or a termination criteria for the
cascades. Such a model could be built on top of our current
model as it is done for example in [16].
In the next Section, we explain the proposed model and
how we estimate its parameters. Section 3 introduces the
datasets and provides a global analysis about their main
characteristics. In Section 4 we explain the main results
and give an interpretation of the parameters of the model.
Finally, in Section 5 we describe related work and discuss
the results in Section 6. In the Appendix we explain some
aspects of the likelihood approach which are important for
the estimation of parameters.
2. GROWING TREE MODELS FOR DISCUS-
SION CASCADES
We model a discussion cascade as a growing network in
which nodes correspond to comments and the initial node
corresponds to the post (a news article, for instance). A
new node is added sequentially at discrete time-steps. Our
model is based on the original PA model to which we add a
bias to the ﬁrst node. Since each new node adds only one
new link to the existing graph, the resulting network is a
tree. We also assume that the total number of nodes N is
known. It is convenient to represent compactly the cascade
as a vector of parent nodes π , where πt denotes the parent
of the node t + 1 added at time-step t.
We are interested in the probability of being node k the
parent πt given the past history π (1:t−1), that is p(πt =
k|π (1:t−1)), for t > 1, k = {1, . . . , t } and initial vector π 1 =
(1) 1. Note that by construction, πt ≤ t, ∀t.
At time-step t, we relate the popularity of a node k with
its number of links (degree dk,t ) before node t + 1 is added
in the following way:
dk,t (π (1:t−1)) =
{
1 + ∑ t−1
m=2 δkπ m for k ∈ { 1, . . . , t }
0 otherwise , (1)
where δ is the Kronecker delta function. In the following,
we omit the explicit dependence on π (1:t−1), so that dk,t ≡
dk,t (π (1:t−1)).

Figure 2: Small example: at time-step 9, node num-
ber 10 is added to the cascade. With probability
proportional to (βd 1)α 1 it is added to the root node
(initiator) and with probability proportional to dα c
k′
to one of the non-root nodes. Bottom right shows
the corresponding parent vector π (see text for def-
initions).
The PA model attaches new nodes to node k with prob-
ability proportional to its popularity. See Figure 2 for an
illustration. For completeness, we consider two models: a
simple PA model without bias to the root and a model which
diﬀerentiates between the root node and the rest.
1 At time 0 we have π 0 = () and for all trees, p(π1 = 1) = 1
and 0 otherwise, i.e. π 1 = (1) always.
In the general PA model, the probability for attaching the
node t+1 to node k at time-step t > 1 is parameterized using
a linear term βk and an exponent α k for each of the nodes:
p(πt = k|π (1:t−1)) = 1
Zt
(βkdk,t )α k , Z t =
t∑
l=1
(βldl,t )α l .
(2)
Model without bias : If we set α k = α and βk = 1, for
k = {1, . . . , t }, we recover an important generalization of
Barabasi’s PA model, where the probability of attachment
to a node goes as some general power α of the degree [18,
13]. For α = 1, the linear preferential attachment is recov-
ered. In this case, nodes have power-law distributed degree s.
For α < 1, or sublinear PA, the degrees are distributed ac-
cording to a stretched exponential. For α > 1 there is a
“condensation” phenomenon, in which a single node gets a
ﬁnite fraction of all the connections in the network [18].
Model with bias : Consider the following parameteriza-
tion:
α k =
{
α 1 for k = 1
α c for k ∈ { 2, . . . , t }
βk =
{
β for k = 1
1 for k ∈ { 2, . . . , t } . (3)
In this case, α 1 and α c are the exponents of the PA processes
governing the root and the non-root nodes respectively. β
can be regarded as an additional degree of freedom weighting
the root of the tree. In Section 4.4 we discuss about the
interpretability of these parameters.
Note that, although we explicitly model the event which
triggers the cascade as a root node, this representation doe s
not limit the cascade to be originated from an individual
event only. The root node can of course represent a group
of initiators.
2.1 Maximum likelihood parameter estimation
Usually, PA in evolving networks is measured by calculat-
ing the rate at which groups of nodes with identical connec-
tivity form new links during a small time interval ∆ t [13, 4].
However, this approach is suitable only for networks with
many nodes that are stationary in the sense that the num-
ber of nodes remain constant during the interval ∆ t. This
is not a reasonable assumption in our data, which is often
produced by a transient, highly nonstationary, response.
Another approach for parameter estimation relies on ﬁt-
ting a measured property, for instance the degree distribu-
tion, for which an analytical form can be derived in the
model under consideration. For the PA model, extensive
results exist with emphasis precisely on the degree distri-
butions [3]. However, two important aspects are worth to
mention here. First, analytical results usually rely on as-
sumptions like a continuum limit or on an inﬁnite size net-
work, which is also not the case of our data. Second, it is
important to stress here that when parameters are learned
for a particular observable for which an analytical form has
been derived, the model may overﬁt on this measure, intro-
ducing a bias in other structural properties such as subtree
sizes, average depths, or other correlations.
Our approach considers the likelihood function correspond -
ing to the entire generative process (instead of particular
measures such as degree distributions or subtree sizes) int ro-
duced before. We can assign to each observation (each node
arrival in each cascade) a given probability using Equation
(2). The parameters for which the likelihood is maximal are
the ones that best explain the data given the model assump-
tions (see [25] for a similar approach for another network
growth model).
Formally, we observe a set Π := {π 1, . . . π N } of N trees
with respective sizes |π i|, i ∈ { 1, . . . N } and we want to ﬁnd
the values of θ := ( α 1, α c, β ) which best explain the data.
The likelihood function can be written as:
L(Π |θ) =
N∏
i=1
p(π i|θ)
=

i=1
|π i|∏

, (4)
where π (1:t−1),i is the vector of parents in the tree i after
time t − 1, x := πt,i is the parent of node t + 1 in the tree
i, and dx,t,i := dx,t (π (1:t−1),i ) denotes the degree of node x
as in Equation (1) in the tree i. Instead of maximizing (4)
directly, it is more convenient to minimize the negative of
the log-likelihood function:
log L(Π |θ) =
N∑
i=1
|π i|∑
t=2
α x(log βx + log dx,t,i ) − log Zt,i (π i|θ),
(5)
where Zt,i (π i|θ) = ∑ t
l=1 (βldl,t,i )α l .
For more details about the optimization see the Appendix.
3. DATASETS
We have analyzed the discussion cascades of four websites.
In the following paragraphs we give a more detailed descrip-
tion of the datasets and the corresponding websites. Global
descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1.
Slashdot (SL) : Slashdot 2 is a popular technology-news
website created in 1997 that publishes frequently short new s
posts and allows its readers to comment on them. Slashdot
has a community based moderation system that awards a
score to every comment and upholds the quality of discus-
sions. The comments can be nested which allows us to ex-
tract the tree structure of the discussion. A single news pos t
triggers typically about 200 comments (most of them in a
few hours) during the approx. 2 weeks he is open for discus-
sion. Our dataset contains the entire amount of discussions
generated at Slashdot during a year (from August 2005 to
August 2006). See [8] for more details about this dataset.
Barrapunto (BP) : Barrapunto 3 is a Spanish version
of Slashdot created in 1999. It runs the same open source
software as Slashdot, making the visual and functional ap-
pearance of the two sites very similar. They diﬀer in the
language they use and the content of the news stories dis-
played, which normally does not overlap. The volume of ac-
tivity on Barrapunto is signiﬁcantly lower. A news story on
Barrapunto triggers on average around 50 comments. Our

dataset contains the activity on Barrapunto during three
years (from January 2005 to December 2008).
Meneame (MN) : Meneame4 is the most successful Span-
ish news aggregator. The website is based on the idea of pro-
moting user-submitted links to news (stories) according to
user votes. It was launched in December of 2005 as a Span-
ish equivalent to Digg. The entry page of Meneame consists
of a sequence of stories recently promoted to the front page,
as well as a link to pages containing the most popular, and
newly submitted stories. Registered users can, among other
things: (a) publish links to relevant news which are retained
in a queue until they collect a suﬃcient number of votes to
be promoted to the front page of Meneame, (b) comment
on links sent by other users (or themselves), (c) vote ( men-
ear) comments and links published by other users. Contrary
to both BP and SL, Meneame lacks an interface for nested
comments. Comments are displayed as a list so that the
tree structure is hidden However, the tag #n can be used to
indicate a reply to the n-th comment in the comment list
and to extract the tree structures we analyze in this study.
To focus on the most representative cascades, we ﬁlter out
stories that were not promoted, that is marked as discarded,
abuse, etc. Our dataset contains the promoted stories and
corresponding comments during the interval between Dec.
2005 and July 2009.
Wikipedia (WK) : The English Wikipedia 5 is the largest
language version of Wikipedia. Every article in Wikipedia
has its corresponding article talk page where users can dis-
cuss on improving the article. For our analysis we used a
dump of the English Wikipedia of March 2010 which con-
tained data of about 3.2 million articles, out of which about
870,000 articles had a corresponding discussion page with a t
least one comment. In total these article discussion pages
contained about 9.4 million signed comments. Note that the
comments are never deleted, so this number reﬂects the to-
tality of comments ever made about the articles in the dump.
The oldest comments date back to as early as 2001. Com-
ments who are considered a reply to a previous comment
are indented, which allows to extract the tree structure of
the discussions. Note that Wikipedia discussion pages con-
tain, in addition to comments, structural elements such as
subpages, headlines, etc. which help to organize large dis-
cussions. We eliminate all this elements and just concentra te
our analysis on the remaining pure discussion trees. More
details about the dataset and the corresponding data prepa-
ration and cleaning process can be found in [19]. For our
experiments we selected a random subset of 50 , 000 articles
from the entire dataset. Results did not vary signiﬁcantly
when using diﬀerent random subsets of the data.

3.1 Global analysis
In this section we give a brief overview about some gen-
eral characteristics of the four datasets. Several indicat ors
are shown in Table 1. As columns 4 and 5 show, the biggest
observed discussions can be composed of hundreds of com-
ments and propagate across hundreds of users. We ﬁnd the
biggest discussion in Wikipedia, involving 5 , 969 users and
32, 664 comments. In Barrapunto, however, the biggest con-
versation comprised 180 users and 841 comments.
It is interesting to consider this quantity relative to the
size of the underlying social network (compare columns 5
and 6, where we indicate the total number of users during the
crawled period). We see a remarkable fact: the percentage
of users aﬀected by the largest cascade is very small. In
particular, it varies from a 1 . 1% for Slashdot and 2 . 6% in
Barrapunto, the dataset which we saw that presented the
smallest cascade in absolute terms. Globally, these result s
show that even the largest cascades only aﬀect a very small
portion of the entire underlying social network.
A characteristic feature of discussion cascades is the high
frequency of user participation. Evidence of this is provid ed
in column 7, where we show the percentage of cascades in
which at least one user is involved more than once for cas-
cades with more than two nodes (for MN and WK, we also
show the percentage for cascades with more than ﬁve nodes).
With the exception of Meneame, all datasets show very high
values. In Slashdot, practically all posts contained at lea st
one user who commented more than once (considering only
registered users). An important consequence of this fact is
that information diﬀusion may not be properly explained
using epidemic models such as SIR (susceptible-infected-
recovered) models unlike in other scenarios like photo pop-
ularity [5] or fanning pages [24].

itively skewed, showing a high concentration of relatively
short cascades and a long tail with large cascades. However,
although all distributions are heavy tailed, we clearly see
a diﬀerent pattern between the three news aggregators and
the Wikipedia. Whereas SL, BP and MN present a distribu-
tion with a deﬁned scale, the distribution of cascade sizes o f
Wikipedia is closer to a scale-free distribution, in line wi th
the cascades found in weblogs [20] and USENET [16]. We
remark that, even in the Wikipedia case, the power-law hy-
pothesis for the tail of this distribution is not plausible v ia
rigorous test analysis: we obtain an exponent of 2 . 17 at the
cost of discarding 97% of the data.
We also observe a progressive deviation from websites with
a well deﬁned scale such as Slashdot, which could be de-
scribed using a log-normal probability distribution, towa rds
websites with less deﬁned scale such as Meneame, which may
show a power-law behavior for cascade sizes > 50. Barra-
punto falls in the middle and, interestingly, is more simila r
to Meneame than to Slashdot.
The previous considerations imply that, in general, a new
post in Slashdot can hardly stay unnoticed and will propa-
gate almost surely over several users. Conversely, most of
the news in Meneame will only provoke a small reaction and
reach, if they do, a small group of users. Compared with
Wikipedia, we can say that Meneame is the news aggrega-
tor which has most similarities with it.
Figure 1 illustrates the diﬀerent types of cascades which
we found. We plot representative cascades with similar size s
selected randomly from each of the four datasets. For Slash-
dot we can see that the chain reaction is located mainly on
the initiator event (direct reactions), but some nodes also
have high degree, resulting in bursty disseminations. We
could say that after a news article is posted, the collective
attention is constantly drifting from the main post to some
new comments which become more popular. In Barrapunto
we observe similar structures, although their persistence is
less noticeable. On the contrary, Meneame is characterized
by having high concentration of nodes at the ﬁrst level to-
gether with rare but long chains of thin threads. This repre-
sents a pattern where only a few comments receive multiple
replies, but that sporadically can trigger a long dialog be-
tween a few users. We note that this phenomenon might be
caused by the fact that the cascade tree and, more impor-
tantly, the number of replies a comment receives are hidden
in the interface of Meneame. Finally, the case of Wikipedia
is very similar to Meneame, but with even longer, more fre-
quent and ﬁner threads of nodes with very low degree.
4. RESULTS
In this section we validate the proposed model by compar-
ing the real cascades to the ones generated using the model.
4.1 Model validation description
We use the cascades from the four datasets to validate
the proposed PA model with bias. The parameters are
optimized for each dataset independently using the entire
dataset and we generate the same number of synthetic cas-
cades as the number of real cascades extracted from each
dataset. An alternative validation would be to use a train-
test paradigm on each dataset independently to prevent over -
ﬁtting. For simplicity, and since the goal of this study is to
characterize the diﬀerent datasets instead of minimizing t he
generalization error of new threads sampled from the model,
we prefer to use the entire datasets for learning. 6
The size of each synthetic cascade is pre-determined draw-
ing a pseudo-random number from the empirical distribution
of cascade sizes (see Figure 3). We calculate the following
quantities from the empirical data and from the synthetic
cascades produced by the model:
Root node degree probability distribution: Each cas-
cade has a root degree, which is the number of direct
contributions to the root.
Total degree distribution: We consider the degree prob-
ability distribution of any node, without diﬀerentiating
root versus non-root nodes.
Subtree sizes distribution: For each non-root node, we
compute the probability distribution of the total num-
ber of its descendants.
Mean node depth: Each non-root node belongs to one
level of the cascade. We compute the mean over all
the levels of all the nodes.
6The estimated parameter values did not vary signiﬁcantly
using diﬀerent, suﬃciently large random subsets of the data ,
as the outcomes of a cross-validation (train-test) procedu re
would have produced.

4.2 Structure of the cascades
Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show plots of the previous quantities
for each dataset and the outcomes of both PA models with
and without bias to the root.
Overall, the model with bias is able to capture reasonably
well all the measured properties, except the mean depth. In
particular the degree distributions of the root nodes are ve ry
accurately reproduced, even though each dataset exhibits a
diﬀerent proﬁle (see top-left plot of the ﬁgures). For this
quantity, the diﬀerence between using or not a bias term
is clearly manifested. A model without bias systematically
produces degree distributions too skewed for the non-root
nodes and with too short tails for the root nodes, and is not
able to capture qualitatively the shape of the total degree
distribution (see top-right plots of the ﬁgures).
A similar behavior is observed in the correlations between
the log-size of the cascade and the proportion of direct re-
actions (bottom plots of the ﬁgures). Although the scatter
plots diﬀer substantially across datasets, the model with b ias
is able to reproduce them qualitatively, which is not the cas e
for the model without bias (data not shown).
The model with bias also generates correct subtree sizes
in general, with the exception of Meneame, which we pos-
tulate is caused by the particularities of the platform (see

Section 6 for details). On the contrary, the model without
bias systematically produces longer tails than the real one s.
Both models tend to produce shorter tails for the mean
depth distribution in all datasets. This seems to be a cur-
rent limitation of the model. Although for Slashdot and
Barrapunto this deviation is not very severe, for the other
two datasets we observe clear discrepancies at the tail of th e
distributions. Notice that in this case, the model without
bias is unable even to reproduce the probability mass cor-
responding to the ﬁrst values of the distribution. We will
return to this point in Section 6.
To conclude this section, we show in Figure 4 the syn-
thetic counterpart of Figure 1, where we plot representativ e
cascades with similar sizes selected randomly from each of
the four synthetic datasets. We can see that the generated
cascades present a strong resemblance with the real ones.
4.3 Evolution of the cascades
After having compared the main structural properties of
the synthetic trees with the real ones, we now investigate
whether the PA model with bias is also able to reproduce
the growth process of the cascades. In other words, if we take
intermediate snapshots of the cascades during their evolu-
tion, how close match the synthetic trees their archetypes?
To this end we record two quantities: the width (max-
imum over the number of nodes per level) and the mean
depth of the trees every time a new node is added (at ev-
ery timestep). Note that the timesteps in the model do
not coincide with the actual time diﬀerences between the
comments. They just reﬂect the sequence of the comments

attaching to the cascade. In reality, information spreadin g
is conditioned to the large heterogeneity present in human
activity, for instance induced by circadian cycles, which r e-
sults in information transmission speeds governed by subex -
ponential distributions, i.e. log-normals or power-laws [ 12,
14, 22]. Capturing the growth process of the real cascades
is therefore a challenging task for our model.
The average overall width and depth evolution curves are
presented in Figures 9 and 10 for all datasets comparing the
original cascades (continuous lines with symbols) with the
biased model (dashed lines). We observe a nearly perfect
coincidence between our model and the data in the evolu-
tion of the width of the discussions (Figure 9), for three of
the four datasets. Only in the case of Slashdot the model
underestimates the width of the tree, although it still repr o-
duces the same curve shape if normalized by the ﬁnal depth.
The picture in the case of the mean depth (Figure 10)
is less favorable, but still shows a reasonable coincidence of
our model with the data. In the case of Wikipedia, although
the model underestimates the mean depth, it reproduces a
rescaled version of it. The other datasets show a similar
proﬁle. Initially, the synthetic trees are too deep and the
mean depth is overestimated. This deviation is corrected at
some point and then the opposite eﬀect takes place: when
the depth of the synthetic trees saturates, the depth of the
real ones still grows. The initial deviation is specially se vere
in Slashdot, for which remarkably the ﬁnal mean depth is

4.4 Interpretation of parameters
Can we derive conclusions about the communication habits
which characterize each website based on the obtained pa-
rameters which best ﬁt each model? Figure 11(a) shows the
optimal parameter values for each dataset in a three dimen-
sional plot, where the horizontal and vertical axis corresp ond
to α 1 and α c respectively and the size of the marker to the
value β . Table 2 shows the same values numerically.
The role of the exponents α 1 and α c in the model is to
quantify the degree of preferential attachment of the root

node and the non-root nodes respectively. The higher their
values, the more relevant is the popularity to determine the
attractiveness to new nodes in the cascade. For instance,
values very close to zero imply a random cascade where new
nodes are linked to existing ones with uniform probability.
We can use the established theoretical results described in
Section 2 to characterize the websites under study.
The diﬀerent exponents α 1 are all sublinear ( < 1), rel-
atively high, and very similar in all datasets, indicating a
strong PA in the root process of all cascades. The two
lowest values for this quantity are observed for Barrapunto
and Slashdot. On the other hand, Meneame and Wikipedia
present a higher and almost identical value, suggesting a
very similar role of the root nodes in the PA mechanism of
both websites.
A clear segregation between the group of three news media
websites and the Wikipedia is manifested on Figure 11(a) in
the value of α c. Slashdot, has the highest value, α c ≈ 0. 68,
even higher than α 1 for Barrapunto. It is also very similar
to α 1 for the same dataset. This similarity may capture the
special quality of the Slashdot comments. In a sense, good
comments may behave like posts and may act eventually as
eﬀective initiator of information diﬀusion cascades.

Marker sizes encode β diﬀerently in (a) and (b).
The smaller value of ≈ 0. 2 found for Meneame indicates
that the diﬀusion of the news comments in this website is
closer to a random process. This can be again inﬂuenced
by the lack of explicit information about the popularity of a
given comment. The same is true for Barrapunto although
its value of α c ≈ − 0. 1 is slightly negative, indicating a slight
inverse PA process.
However, such an inverse PA process is much more promi-
nent in the case of Wikipedia: whereas its α 1 is high, indi-
cating a strong PA in the root process in agreement with
the other datasets, its α c is negative and has the largest
absolute value of all four datasets. What are the implica-
tions of this result? Once a comment on a Wikipedia article
has been originated, it will derive in a collaborative recip -
rocal chain between a very reduced group of contributors.
So once a node has received a reply it will be three (ex-
actly: 2 1. 686 = 3 . 2) times less likely to receive another one
than the replying new comment itself. In other words, nodes
with degree equal to one (leaf nodes) are much more likely to
be linked with a new node than nodes which higher degrees.
Finally, the parameter β acts as a weight which expresses
the trend towards the root of the cascade in relation to the
subsequent nodes. It is especially important in the beginni ng
of the cascade, when the degree of the root node is low,
and determines whether initially many nodes attach to the
root or rather to one of the ﬁrst comments. We observe
thus that Meneame shows the largest initial predominance
of direct reactions, while Wikipedia gives higher probabil ity
mass to the comments, allowing thus large chains already
with a small number of nodes. The values for Slashdot and
Barrapunto lie in between indicating an intermediate initi al
preference for the root node, showing Barrapunto a higher
probability for early reply-chains than Slashdot.
What would be the scenario if one tries to explain the
cascades using the simple model without bias to the root?
We also ﬁt the simple PA model to the data. In that case, we
would infer mistakenly that both Meneame and Wikipedia
systems are in the “condensation” regime [18], since their
exponents (1. 360 and 1 . 161 respectively) are larger than one.
The next question we want to answer is how stable are
these parameters within the same site, i.e. if we split for ex -
ample diﬀerent discussions according to their category, do we
obtain similar parameters? We investigate this question fo r
the topic categories in Slashdot (we only consider categori es
with more than 100 discussions) and ﬁnd (see Figure 11(b))
that the majority of topics has a set of parameters which is
close to the one obtained for the entire website.
This is remarkable given the heterogeneous picture that
is observed if the depths and widths of the discussions are
considered [9]. So it seems that, although the amount of
comments which attracts the diﬀerent categories may be
diﬀerent, the actual structure of the discussions follows a
very similar pattern. However, if we consider the α param-
eters, we observe three outliers from the main cluster. The
topics “books” and “ask” have much larger values, indicatin g
a more experienced preferential attachment behavior, whil e
the topic “games” , on the other hand, has the largest diﬀer-
ence between α 1 and α c. It seems that in this topic category
direct comments to the root node are more frequent 7 while
in the two other outliers also comments seem to be able to
attract a reasonable amount of replies. It is also interesti ng
7This category is also the one with the shallowest trees [9].
to observe the diﬀerences in the values of β , where we ﬁnd
the largest trend toward the root for “hardware” and the
smallest for “books” articles.
Summarizing, the optimal parameters permit an interpre-
tation of the communication habits of each social space and
are relatively stable across diﬀerent categories within a s ite.
This representation also leads to diﬀerent classiﬁcation a s
a function of the parameters. The bias to the root node is
crucial to separate Slashdot and Barrapunto from Wikipedia
and Meneame according to α 1, and Wikipedia from the three
news aggregators according to α c.
5. RELATED WORK
Due to the increasing availability of empirical data on cas-
cades, extensive work is appearing with focus on how infor-
mation cascades are propagated in a social network.
At a statistical description level, information cascades h ave
been analyzed in detail for particular social spaces. Twitt er
cascades [17] are predominantly shallow and wide (maxi-
mum depth is 11). Flickr [6] shows the remarkable phe-
nomenon that popular photos spread slowly and not widely.
This is in harmony with our ﬁndings which report that even
the largest realizations reach a very small proportion of th e
social network.
Blog cascades have been analyzed in [20]. Interestingly,
although one would expect blog cascades to share more sim-
ilarities with the discussion cascades existing in Slashdo t
or Meneame, it is the Wikipedia dataset which shows most
similar patterns to the blog cascades (see Figure 3). In [10] ,
a model of both blogger (user) and cascades was presented
which reproduces global temporal and structural aspects of
the blogosphere. We note that the motivation of our work
is rather diﬀerent. Whereas [20, 10] aims for ﬁnding the
simplest, parameter-free model able to describe both user
network and cascade behavior, we look for a parameterized
model from which we can describe communication habits
which characterize a particular website (see Section 4.4). In
contrast to the blog data, the datasets considered here con-
tain complete information of the cascade evolution. In this
sense, our data avoids selection bias which strongly inﬂu-
ences the estimation of these processes [7]. In [7], a simple
branching process (Galton-Watson process) is proposed for
modeling chain-letter cascades. Although such a model may
explain certain characteristics such as depths distributi ons
(after proper correction for selection bias) it cannot capt ure
the cascade evolution and assumes that all degree distribu-
tions are independent, so its utility for our purposes remai ns
very limited.
During the development of this manuscript we learned of
the work of Kumar et al. [16] which also presents a model
for discussion trees, called T-MODEL. The same study also
considers other aspects of the cascades such as the identiti es
of each member of the conversation. Our work is focused on
the cascade model, its parameter estimation and validation
on the four datasets. The same or a diﬀerent authorship
model as the one of [16] could also be built on top of the
model proposed here.
The T-MODEL is based on linear preferential attach-
ment only, and unlike ours does not distinguish between
root and subsequent nodes. However, it includes a recency
term which allows it to capture qualitatively the relation
between the sizes and the depths of the cascades. Prelim-
inary experiments indicate similar ability of our model in
this aspect. Additionally, the bias to the root considered
here clearly permits to capture other quantities with highe r
accuracy, such as the degree distributions or the subtree
sizes. This suggests that at least for the datasets analyzed
here our model performs better. The maximum likelihood
estimation scheme presented here ﬁnds the best parameters
of a model given the data, and therefore allows to quantify
objectively the predictive power of diﬀerent models. Such
a comparison between the two cascade models and possible
hybrid forms is left for future research.
A further diﬀerence between the T-MODEL and our study
is that it also includes a parameter for the termination of
the discussion. The resulting termination probability of a
discussion is independent of its actual structure and could
be substituted by any other model encoding the popularity
of discussions (e.g. [26]), which could also be combined wit h
our model.
6. DISCUSSION
We have presented a thoughtful analysis and comparison
of the structure and evolution of the diﬀerent discussion ca s-
cades of three popular news media websites and the En-
glish Wikipedia. Our analysis highlights the heterogeneit ies
between the discussion cascades, which can be conditioned
from two factors, namely, the page design, or platform, and
the audience. Despite this, we have given evidence that
a simple model can capture most of the structural proper-
ties and the evolution proﬁles of the real cascades with the
particularities of each dataset. Further, we have derived a
rigorous maximum likelihood approach which considers the
entire evolution of the cascade. The learned parameters of
the model proposed here allow for a ﬁgurative description
that characterizes the communication habits of a website.
For some datasets, the model tends to produce too shallow
cascades. We postulate that this occurs especially in matur e
discussions, where interaction at the leaves only happens b e-
tween a few individuals who start to reply mutually to each
other and increase the mean cascade depth considerably. A
possible extension which could correct for that eﬀect is foc us
of current research.

APPENDIX
Log-likelihood function
In this appendix we describe some considerations related to
the log likelihood function (5) we want to minimize. Brieﬂy,
we show that the PA model can be formulated as a proba-
bility distribution which belongs to the exponential famil y.
Consequently, the optimization problem is convex, e.g. has
the convenient property that any local minimum is global.
Without loss of generality we can assume that parameter
βk is of the following form:
β α k
k := exp
(
β ′
k
)
.
We can rewrite the PA model deﬁned in Equation (2) as:
p(πt = k|π (1:t−1)) = 1
Z′
t
exp
(
β ′
k + α k log dk,t
)
,
where Z′
t = ∑ t
l=1 exp (β ′
l + α l log dl,t ). This probability dis-
tribution is equivalent to that of the Equation (2), but ex-
pressed in terms of the exponential family. The log-likelih ood
function (4) can be rewritten as:
log L′(Π |θ) =
N∑
i=1
|π i|∑
t=2
β ′
x + α x log dx,t,i − log Z′
t,i (π i|θ),
where Z′
t,i (π i|θ) = ∑ t
l=1 exp (β ′
l + α l log dl,t,i ). The Hes-
sian of this function (matrix of second order partial deriva -
tives) is always positive semi-deﬁnite.
The presented method can therefore be applied to any
set of observations which can be expressed as a collection
of parent vectors Π from which the degrees of each node at
each time-step can be obtained. Once the minimization is
performed, we can recover the original parameter βk with
βk = exp ( β ′
k/α k) . The basic PA model is the special case
where α = α 1 = α c.
Note that the bias to the root node can be introduced:
(A) Using two alphas α 1, α c but no β (β = 0).
(B) Using one alpha α = α 1 = α c and β .
(C) Using two alphas α = α 1 = α c and β (the approach
presented in this manuscript).
As expected, since model (C) uses more parameters than
(A) and (B), the resulting likelihoods and ﬁts are better. In
particular, the impact of adding β as a parameter is notable
in the approximated measures related to the root node, for
instance the root degree distributions.
Notice that the convexity does not imply uniqueness of op-
timal parameter values. It could happen that the same min-
imum is attained for a large range of parameter values. We
used as an optimization procedure the Nelder-Mead simplex
algorithm (implemented as fminsearch in Matlab) which is
an unconstrained non-linear direct search method that does
not use numerical or analytic gradients. Starting from many
diﬀerent random initial conditions, we did not ﬁnd multiple
optimal values in any of the datasets, so we can conclude
that the presented values for each dataset are unique.
