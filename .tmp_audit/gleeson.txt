Heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity occur natur ally in a model of meme diﬀusion on
social networks. Competition between multiple memes for th e limited resource of user attention is
identiﬁed as the mechanism that poises the system at critica lity. The popularity growth of each
meme is described by a critical branching process, and asymp totic analysis predicts power-law
distributions of popularity with very heavy tails (exponen t α < 2, unlike preferential-attachment
models), similar to those seen in empirical data.

When people select from multiple items of roughly equal value, some ite ms quickly become extremely
popular, while other items are chosen by relatively few people [1]. The p robability Pn(t) that a random
item has been selected n times by time t is often observed to have a heavy-tailed distribution ( n is called the
popularity of the item at time t). In examples where the items are baby names [2], apps on Facebook [3],
retweeted URLs or hashtags on Twitter [4–6], or video views on You Tube [7], the popularity distribution is
found to scale approximately as a power-law Pn ∼ n−α over several decades. The exponent α in all these
examples is less than 2, and typically has a value close to 1.5. This range of α values is notably distinct
from those obtainable from cumulative-advantage or preferentia l-attachment models of Yule-Simon type—
as used to describe power-law degree distributions of networks, f or example [8–11]—which give α ≥ 2.
Interestingly, the value α = 1 .5 is also found for the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes in self -
organized criticality (SOC) models [12, 13], suggesting the possibility t hat the heavy-tailed distributions
of popularity in the examples above are due to the systems being som ehow poised at criticality.
In this paper we present an analytically tractable model of selection behaviour, based on simplifying the
model of Weng et. al [14] for the spreading of memes on a social ne twork. We show that in certain limits
the system is automatically poised at criticality—in the sense that mem e popularities are described by a
critical branching process [15]—and that the criticality can be ascrib ed to the competition between memes
for the limited resource of user attention. We dub this mechanism competition-induced criticality (CIC)
and investigate the impact of the social network topology (degree distribution) and the age of the memes
upon the distribution of meme popularities. We show that CIC gives ris e to heavy-tailed distributions
very similar to the distributions of avalanche sizes in SOC models [16, 17 ], even though our competition
mechanism is quite diﬀerent from the sandpile paradigm of SOC. This wo rk may therefore be of interest
in other areas where SOC-like critical phenomena have been observ ed in experiments or simulations, such
as economic models of competing ﬁrms [18, 19], the evolution and extin ction of competing species [20–22],
and neural activity in the brain [23, 24].
For clarity, we will phrase the model in terms of meme diﬀusion as in [14 ] but the same understanding of
the basic mechanism—and the analytical techniques for time-depen dent distributions—can also be applied
to other models, including the random-copying popularity models of [ 2, 25, 26]. The role of competition
among items for limited resources has been examined from many viewp oints: see, for example, [27–29] and
also related work on competing diseases [30–32]. The distribution of p opularity increments (number of
selections of an item in a small time interval) in Moran-type models has b een obtained analytically [26];
however, our focus is on the (time-dependent) distributions of po pularity accumulated over long timescales.
We consider a model of a directed social network, like Twitter, wher e nodes represent users; there are
N nodes and we will take the limit N → ∞ in our analysis. A randomly-chosen user has k followers (i.e.,
FIG. 1: Schematic of the model. Time runs horizontally and no des of the network are listed vertically; the screen
colour of each node indicates the meme it currently holds. At time t1, node 1 retweets the blue meme to its followers
(nodes 2 and 3). At time t2, node 1’s screen is overwritten by the red meme, which was twe eted by one of the nodes
followed by node 1.
out-degree k, note we use the convention that network edges are directed fro m nodes to their followers)
with probability pk. Each node has a screen, which holds the meme of current interest to that node (see
Fig. 1). For simplicity, we assume here that each screen has capacit y for only one meme, though this case
is easily extended [47]. During each time step (with time increment ∆ t = 1 /N), one node is chosen at
random. With probability µ, the selected node innovates, i.e., generates a brand-new meme, that appears
on its screen, and is tweeted (broadcast) to all the node’s follower s. Otherwise (with probability 1 − µ),
the selected node (re)tweets the meme currently on its screen (if there is one) to all its followers, and the
screen is unchanged. If there is no meme on the node’s screen, not hing happens. When a meme m is
tweeted, the popularity of meme m is incremented by 1 and the memes currently on the followers’ scree ns
are overwritten by meme m.
Two memes; initially no competition: As a ﬁrst examination of the model’s dynamics, we consider just
two memes (called red and blue), each of which is initally present on a sm all number of screens, with every
other screen being empty, and with no innovation ( µ = 0). A simple mean-ﬁeld analysis of this two-meme
case gives some useful insight. We assume all nodes have z followers, and follow z others, where z is the
mean out-degree ∑
k kpk of the network. Let r(t) be the fraction of screens occupied by the red meme
at time t, with b(t) the corresponding fraction of blue-meme screens. Since nodes a re selected at random
to tweet, the expected popularity (i.e., the cumulative number of tw eets up to time t) for the red meme,
nr(t), is related to r(t) by dnr/dt = r(t), with a similar relation for the blue meme. Under the mean-ﬁeld
assumptions, a deterministic approximation for r(t) and b(t) is given by the solution of the pair of equations
dr
dt = −zbr + zr(1 − r), db
dt = −zbr + zb(1 − b). (1)
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of the ﬁrst equation, for ex ample, accounts for a decrease in the
number of red-meme screens due to memes being overwritten by blu e-tweeting nodes. This occurs when
a blue meme is tweeted (with probability b(t) in a given time step), and aﬀects a fraction r(t) of the z
followers of the tweeting node, giving the term −zbr. The second term describes the growth of red memes
due to a red meme tweeting (with probability r(t)) to non-red followers, the expected number of which is
z(1 − r(t)).
Equations (1) can be solved analytically: the fraction of non-empty screens is i(t) = r(t) + b(t), with
i(0) ≪ 1, and its dynamics obey the logistic diﬀerential equation di/dt = zi(1 − i), which is precisely the

mean-ﬁeld approximation for the infected population fraction in a su sceptible-infected (SI) epidemic model.
When r(t) and b(t) are both very small the solutions show exponential growth in scre en occupation, and
hence in the accumulated tweets (i.e., popularities) nr(t) and nb(t)—see Fig. 2(a)—similar to early-stage
growth of independent diseases [33]. The exponential growth cont inues until i(t) is of order 1, by which
time most screens show either the red or the blue meme. When r(t) + b(t) = 1, the right hand sides of
Eqs. (1) are both zero. This means that—under the mean-ﬁeld ass umptions that give this deterministic
limit—the numbers of screens showing each meme remain constant th ereafter, and so the popularities nr(t)
and nb(t) grows linearly in time, as in Fig. 2(b). This balance is a dynamic one, as t he two memes continue
to compete for the resource of screen space, but the rate of gr owth for each meme is precisely equal to the
rate of loss due to being overwritten by the other meme. Thus the lin ear growth in popularity is induced
by the competition between memes, in contrast to the exponential growth at earlier times (Fig. 2(a)) when
the memes were not competing for the same resources [7, 29].
The mean-ﬁeld approximation used above ignores ﬁnite- N eﬀects, which cause stochastic ﬂuctuations in
the number of screens about the mean values r(t) and b(t). In the long-time limit, it is these ﬂuctuations
that eventually lead to one meme becoming extinct, with the other ﬁllin g all screens (as in Fig. 2(c)).
Stochastic ﬂuctuations are also important at early times, when the re are only very few screens showing
either meme. In order to model the important role of stochastic ﬂu ctuations, and also to examine how
the results presented here extend to cases with very many memes , we next consider a heavily-competitive
environment containing multiple memes.
Multiple competing memes: Now suppose that there are no empty screens in the network—so w e are in
the highly-competitive regime—and the innovation probability µ may be non-zero. Competition between
memes for the limited resource of user attention (i.e., screen space ) leads naturally to some memes becoming
extremely popular, while others are only moderately popular, or are ignored. We show that the model
3
produces fat-tailed distributions of popularity, which are power-la w in the limit µ → 0. This is explained
using a branching process description of the model, where the comp etitive environment causes each meme
to follow a critical branching process (for which power-law distribut ions are expected [16, 27]).
The branching process description is strictly valid only when the numb er of screens occupied by a single
meme is a small fraction of N, but we note that this is the case for long epochs of time in a competit ive
environment with many memes. We assume here that all nodes follow ( approximately) z other nodes,
so the in-degree distribution is homogeneous, but we consider hete rogeneous distributions of out-degrees.
Before examining the details of the branching process, it is worth hig hlighting the source of criticality in
the model when µ = 0. In a single time step ∆ t, a tweeting node creates (or “gives birth to”) an average of
z∆ t new copies of the meme on its screen by overwriting the screens of it s followers. However, each screen
can be overwritten by another meme (causing “death” of the over written meme) with probability z∆ t,
and so the birth and death rates of memes are, on average, exact ly balanced, giving a critical branching
process. This balance between births and deaths remains critical w hen the model is enhanced in several
ways, including modifying the rules so that nodes retweet any given m eme at most once, see Sec. S5 of
[47].
Next we give details of the branching process description of the mod el. We denote the distribution of
popularities at age a by qn(a): this is the probability that a meme has been tweeted n times when its age
is a (i.e., at a time tb + a, where tb is the birth time of the meme). This distribution can be represented
via its probability generating function (PGF) [34, 35] H(a, x), deﬁned by H(a, x) ≡ ∑ ∞
n=1 qn(a)xn. The
network topology is described by the PGF for the out-degree distr ibution: f(x) ≡ ∑ ∞
k=0 pkxk. The mean
degree is z = f′(1) and we assume all nodes have in-degree z.
To calculate qn(a), we ﬁrst ﬁnd H(a, x) and then employ an inversion technique based on Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) [31, 36, 37]. It proves convenient to introduc e G(a, x), deﬁned as the PGF for the excess
popularity distribution at age a of memes that originate from a single randomly-chosen screen (the root of
the tree). The tweet event that creates the root is not counted by G: this event increases the popularity
of the meme by 1, and places the meme upon the root screen and the screens of all followers of the root
node. Consequently, the PGF for the popularity of age- a memes is given by H(a, x) = x G(a, x) f(G(a, x)).
In Sec. S1 of [47] we derive the following ordinary diﬀerential equatio n for G(a, x), parameterized by x:
∂G
∂a = z + µ − (z + 1)G + (1 − µ)x G f (G). (2)
This equation is easily solved using standard numerical methods, sta rting from the initial condition
G(0, x) = 1. Some analysis is also possible [47]: the mean popularity ∂H/∂x (a, 1), for example, grows
linearly with age until a is of the order 1 /µ(z + 1), thereafter it saturates at a value of 1 /µ. By expanding
G(a, x) as a Taylor series about x = 0, the probabilities qn(a) for low n may be determined explicitly.
The popularity distribution for larger values of n are determined in a computationally eﬃcient manner
using FFTs [31, 36, 37]: our implementation (Sec. S2 of [47]) determine s probabilities qn for n values up to
several thousand, shown as black curves in Fig. 3 [48]. The coloured symbols are the results of stochastic
simulations of the model, giving popularity distributions for memes at v arious ages a. The match between
theory and simulation is very good. Figure 3(a) shows the popularity distributions on networks where
each node has exactly z = 10 followers, while Fig. 3(b) is for a network where the number of fo llowers
(out-degree of a node) has a power-law distribution: pk ∝ k−γ for k ≥ 4, with γ = 2 .5 (and pk = 0 for
k < 4). In both cases the k followers of a given node are assigned at random, so the in-degree d istributions
are Poisson.
The observed power-law popularity distributions can be understoo d using the long-time (or “old-age”,
a → ∞ ) asymptotics of the branching process, found by analyzing the limit ing solutions of Eq. (2) in the
complex x-plane (Sec. S3 of [47]); we summarize the main results as follows. If t he out-degree distribution pk
has a ﬁnite second moment (i.e., if f′′(1) < ∞), then the a → ∞ limit of the popularity distribution has the
asymptotic form qn(∞) ∼ A n− 3

This formula shows that the popularity distribution is of power-law fo rm n−3/2, up to an exponential cutoﬀ
at n ≈ κ. However, the cutoﬀ size κ limits to inﬁnity as the innovation rate µ goes to zero, and κ can be
large even for non-zero µ if the second moment of the distribution pk is large (since f′′(1) = ∑
k k(k−1)pk).
If pk ∝ k−γ for large k with 2 < γ < 3, then f′′(1) is inﬁnite, and a diﬀerent asymptotic analysis is
required. In this case we ﬁnd, similar to [16], that as n → ∞ ,
qn(∞) ∼

with prefactors B and C given in [47]. Thus in the zero-innovation limit, the popularity distributio n has
a power-law exponent γ/(γ − 1) that is smaller than the exponent γ of the out-degree distribution.
Figure 3(c) compares theory and simulation results for the model o n the real Twitter network of [38, 39].
The theory matches the simulation results rather well, despite the f act that this network is not tree-
like—indeed, 44% of links are reciprocal links— and does not have a hom ogeneous in-degree distribution,
as assumed in the derivation of the theory. The accuracy of result s from tree-based theories applied to
real-world networks has been noted previously [40] and is examined further for this model in Sec. S4 of [47].
Conclusions: We have used a simple model of meme diﬀusion to illustrate the phenome non of competition-
induced criticality. It is straightforward to generalize the basic mod el and the derivation of Eq. (2)—for
example, by: (i) increasing the capacity of screens to c > 1 memes, (ii) allowing followers to reject a meme
tweeted to them with some probability so it does not appear on their s creen, or (iii) permitting nodes to
retweet a meme at most once—and to show that the CIC property is retained in the more general cases [47].
Despite their simplicity, we believe that the understanding of such an alytically tractable models provides
5
important insights on the origin of regularities observed in empirical d ata. For instance, our model does
not include fat-tailed distributions of in-degrees, user activity leve ls, or response times [4, 14, 41]—these
will be added in future work—but it can nevertheless produce fat-t ailed popularity distributions.
We have also shown that the CIC model produces avalanches of pop ularity whose sizes have the same
steady-state distributions as those found in sandpile models of self -organized criticality [16]. This is
intriguing because the CIC mechanism is quite distinct from the sandp ile paradigm: nodes do not have
thresholds for triggering avalanches, for example, and the CIC po pularity avalanches evolve on the same
timescale as the general dynamics. We speculate that competition f or limited resources may therefore
play an important role in many other application areas where SOC-like p henomena have been identiﬁed
in experiments or numerical simulations [18–24].

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
S1 DERIV ATION OF EQUATION (2)
In the main text we introduced G(a, x) as the probability generating function (PGF) of the excess
popularity distribution, and H(a, x) as the PGF of the popularity distribution, with
H(a, x) = x G(a, x) f(G(a, x))
=
∞∑
n=0
qn(a)xn, (S1)
where qn(a) is the probability that a meme of age a has popularity n. It proves convenient here to also
introduce G(k)(a, x), the PGF of the excess popularity distribution for a meme seeded b y (i.e., ﬁrst tweeted
by) a node with out-degree k; we call this node’s screen the root screenof the retweet-cascade tree. Using
the out-degree distribution pk of the network, we have the relation
G(a, x) =
∑
k
pkG(k)(a, x). (S2)
The meme on the root screen is the root of the cascade tree that r esults from the meme being tweeted
and subsequently retweeted over a period of time, see Fig. 1 of the main text. If we ﬁx a time t = Ω as
the observation time for the cascade sizes, then G(a, x) is the PGF for the sizes (as observed at time Ω)
of trees that are rooted at time Ω − a ≡ τ. We derive a relation between the PGF for the sizes of trees at
age a (i.e., those rooted at time Ω − a) and the PGF for tree sizes at age a − ∆ t (i.e., those rooted at time
Ω − a + ∆ t), as follows.
Consider a meme on a given screen (call this screen S1), at time t = τ : this is the root of the tree we
call Tree( S1), which has age a at the observation time t = Ω; let k be the out-degree of the node with
screen S1. At the next time step t = τ + ∆ t, there are four possible outcomes for this particular screen
that contribute to the PGF G(k)(a, x), refer to Fig. S1:
• Outcome (a): the screen S1 is overwritten by some other meme that is tweeted by another node .
This terminates Tree( S1)—setting the corresponding generating function to 1—as no futu re tweets
7
can now result from the chosen root. Outcome (a) occurs with pro bability z∆ t, since a node follows,
on average, z other nodes, each of which is the tweeter with probability 1 /N = ∆ t. So outcome (a)
contributes z∆ t (the probability of occurrence multiplied by the resulting generating function term)
to the PGF G(k)(a, x). (Note that all terms of order (∆ t)2 and higher are ignored here and below,
as these are negligible when we take the limit ∆ t → 0.)
• Outcome (b): the screen S1 is selected as the updater in the current time step (with probability ∆ t)
and innovates (with probability µ), so terminating Tree( S1). The contribution to G(k)(a, x) is thus
µ∆ t.
• Outcome (c): the screen S1 is selected for update (probability ∆ t) and retweets its meme (probability
1 − µ). This (i) adds one to the size of Tree( S1), whilst (ii) the branch on screen S1 survives another
time step, becoming the origin of a new tree rooted at τ +∆ t, which has age a−∆ t at the observation
time. Moreover, (iii) screen S1 is the parent of k new branches of Tree( S1): each new branch acts
as the root of a tree with PGF G(a − ∆ t, x) (since the out-degrees of the newly-spawned roots are
random). These eﬀects (i)–(iii) lead to generating function contrib utions of x, G(k)(a − ∆ t, x), and
[G(a−∆ t, x)]k, respectively, and since these occur simultaneously, the overall c ontribution of outcome
(c) to G(k)(a, x) is (1 − µ)∆ t x G(k)(a − ∆ t, x)[G(a − ∆ t, x)]k.
• Outcome (d): the survival of Tree( S1), with none of the other outcomes (a)–(c) occurring: the
probability of this is 1 −(z∆ t+µ∆ t+(1 −µ)∆ t) = 1 −(z+1)∆ t, and the screen can then be considered
as the origin of a new tree that is rooted at time τ + ∆, and so has age a − ∆ at the observation time
Ω. The overall contribution to G(k)(a, x) from this outcome is therefore (1 −(z +1)∆ t)G(k)(a−∆ t, x).
Putting all four outcomes together gives an expression for G(k)(a, x), correct to ﬁrst order in ∆ t:
G(k)(a, x) =

(c)
+ (1 − (z + 1)∆ t)G(k)(a − ∆ t, x)  

, (S3)
and taking the limit ∆ t → 0 yields an ordinary diﬀerential equation for G(k)(a, x), parameterized by x:
∂G(k)
∂a = z + µ − (z + 1)G(k) + (1 − µ)x G(k) [G]k. (S4)
Averaging over the possible out-degrees of the root node—by mult iplying by pk and summing over all
k—gives the following equation for G(a, x):
∂G
∂a = z + µ − (z + 1)G + (1 − µ)x
∑

pk G(k) [G]k. (S5)
Solving this equation for G requires also ﬁnding the functions G(k), for all k. However, if we make the

we obtain the single diﬀerential equation for G(a, x) given by Eq. (2) of the main text. The simplifying
moment-closure assumption (S6) will be examined in detail in further work; our numerical simulations
indicate that it leads to quite accurate results for networks with re asonably large mean degree z (e.g.
z ≈ 10 as in Fig. 3(a) and (b) of the main text).

It is straightforward to generalize the derivation above to allow eac h node’s screen to have capacity c ≥ 1,
meaning that the screen can simultaneously hold c memes: we then consider each screen to be composed
of c distinct screen-slots. When retweeting, a node (user) chooses one of their c screen-slots at random to
determine the meme that is transmitted to its followers; if the chose n screen-slot is empty then nothing
happens. When a node innovates, or when it receives a meme from an other node, the new meme is placed
in a randomly-chosen screen-slot, overwriting any existing meme in t hat slot. An additional generalization
is to allow for tweeted memes to be accepted onto followers’ screen s with probability λ ≤ 1 (with λ = 1
giving the base case of the main text). Incorporating these gener alizations into the derivation above leads
to the following equation for G(a, x):
c∂G
∂a = λz + µ − (λz + 1)G + (1 − µ)x G f (1 − λ + λG), (S7)
which reduces to Eq. (2) of the main text in the case c = 1 and λ = 1; the corresponding equation for
H(a, x) is H = x G f (1 − λ + λG). We use this more general case throughout the Supplementary M aterial
to demonstrate that the competition-induced criticality phenomen on is robust to changes in the model.

Higher-order moments of the popularity distribution qn can be obtained similarly by repeated diﬀerentiation
of Eq. (S7). It is also possible to directly determine the probabilities qn(a) for small values of n, by
expanding G(a, x) as a Taylor series about x = 0. Setting x = 0 in Eq. (S7), for example, immediately
yields a closed equation for G(a, 0):
cdG(a, 0)
da = λz + µ − (λz + 1)G(a, 0), (S11)
with solution
G(a, 0) = λz + µ + (1 − µ)e− λz +1
c a
λz + 1 . (S12)
The value of q1(a)—the probability that a meme of age a remains at popularity n = 1 (i.e., has not been
retweeted a time a after its initial tweeting) is then q1(a) = G(a, 0)f(1 − λ + λG(a, 0)) and as a → ∞ ,
q1(a) approaches the value
λz + µ
λz + 1 f
(
1 − λ + λλz + µ
λz + 1
)
. (S13)
This is the fraction of memes that are forgotten before they are r etweeted even once and so their popularity
remains at its initial value of n = 1 forever [6, 42].

where H is obtained as x G(a, x) f(G(a, x) from the (numerical) solution of Eq. (S7). However, numerical
diﬀerentiation is inaccurate for large values of n, so we invert the PGF using contour integration in the
complex x-plane [35, 36]. The inversion integral is given by Cauchy’s theorem
qn(a) = 1

S3 OLD-AGE ASYMPTOTICS
The large- n asymptotic behaviour of qn(a) can be obtained in the limit a → ∞ by asymptotic analysis
of the solution of Eq. (S7), with
lim
a→∞
H(a, x) = x G(∞, x) f(1 − λ + λG(∞, x)), (S18)
where G(∞, x) = lim a→∞ G(a, x). The following general result will prove useful (cf. Lemma 5.3.2 of
Ref. [34]):
Lemma 1 Let Φ( x) = ∑ ∞
k=0 πkxk be the PGF for the distributionπk, and suppose Φ has the following

where w = 1 − x and β1 < β 2 < . . . are positive, non-integer powers (note that the analytic part of Φ can
be written as a power series inw with integer powers). Then the leading-order asymptotic behaviour of πk
is
πk ∼ c1
Γ(−β1) k−β1−1 as k → ∞ , (S20)
where Γ is the Gamma function.

FIG. S2: The contour C in the complex x-plane for the PGF inversion integral (S21). A branch cut ext ends from

To prove this result, we begin with the inversion integral
πk = 1
2πi
∮

Φ( x)x−k−1 dx, (S21)
where the contour C can be deformed onto the contour Cǫ ∪ l1 ∪ CR ∪ l2 shown in Fig. S2. The point

integrals along the circular contours Cǫ and CR limit to zero as ǫ → 0 and R → ∞ [43], leaving

Along the rays l1 and l2 we make the substitution x = eρ to obtain integrals whose asymptotic behaviour
may be determined using Watson’s Lemma [44]. The contributions fro m the analytic part of Φ to the
l1 integral and to the l2 integral cancel each other. Along the branch cut, we write the lea ding-order
non-analytic term of (S19) as

The integral in this expression evaluates to Γ( β1 + 1) k−β1−1. Using the Euler reﬂection formula
π/ sin(πβ1) = Γ( β1)Γ(1 − β1) and the Gamma function property Γ( y + 1) = yΓ(y) completes the proof.
The following result allows the large- n asymptotic behaviour of qn to be determined from the asymptotic
form of G(∞, x):
Lemma 2 Let H(∞, x) = x G(∞, x)f(1 − λ + λG(∞, x)) be the PGF for the distributionqn, and suppose
G(∞, 1 − w) ∼ 1 − φ(w) as w → 0, (S24)
where w = 1 − x. Then the asymptotic form ofH(∞, x) is
H(∞, 1 − w) ∼ 1 − w − (λz + 1)φ(w) as w → 0, (S25)
and applying Lemma 1 allows the asymptotics ofqn to be determined from the nonanalytic part ofφ(w).
The proof requires only the Taylor expansion of f(1 − λ + λ(1 − φ)) to ﬁrst order in φ, noting that φ(0) = 0
and f′(1) = z.
Turning now to the long-time (old-age) limit of Eq. (S7), G(∞, x) is the solution of
λz + µ − (λz + 1)G + (1 − µ)x G f (1 − λ + λG) = 0 . (S26)
We seek an asymptotic series solution for G(∞, x) by inserting the expression
G(∞, 1 − w) ∼
∑
m
cmwβm (S27)
into Eq.(S26) to determine the successive values of βm needed to balance the leading-order powers of
w = 1 − x. Then we apply Lemmas 1 and 2 to determine the asymptotic form of qn for large n values.
• Case 1: f′′(1) inﬁnite, µ = 0
An out-degree distribution with power-law tail pk ∼ Dk−γ with γ between 2 and 3 has a divergent
second moment, so f′′(1) is inﬁnite, and the behaviour of f(x) near x = 1 is given by Lemma 1 as
f(1 − w) ∼ 1 − zw + DΓ(1 − γ)wγ−1 as w → 0 (S28)
(recall z = f′(1) is the mean degree). For µ = 0, inserting expansion (S27) into Eq. (S26) then yields
the leading-order asymptotic behaviour of G as
G(∞, 1 − w) ∼ 1 − 1
λ (DΓ(1 − γ))− 1
γ −1 w
1
γ −1 as w → 0, (S29)
and the popularity distribution asymptotics follow from Lemmas 1 and 2:
qn ∼ Bn− γ
γ −1 as n → ∞ , (S30)
with prefactor
B = −(λz + 1) (DΓ(1 − γ))− 1
γ −1
λΓ
(

1−γ
) . (S31)
The network used in Fig. 3(b) of the main text, for example, has out -degree distribution pk = Dk−γ
for k ≥ 4, with pk = 0 for k < 4: the absence of degrees less than 4 ensures that the mean degr ee z
is reasonably large ( z = 10 .6 for γ = 2 .5), as assumed in the theory. The normalization constant D
for this case is
D = 1
ζ(γ) − 1 − 2−γ − 3−γ , (S32)
where ζ is the Riemann zeta function, allowing the prefactor B to be calculated explicitly from
Eq. (S31).
12
• Case 2: f′′(1) inﬁnite, 0 < µ < 1
When f is given by Eq. (S28) and µ > 0, the leading-order behaviour of G is found to have the form
G(∞, 1 − w) ∼ 1 − 1 − µ
µ(λz + 1) w + DΓ(1 − γ)λγ−1
[ 1 − µ
µ(λz + 1)
] γ
wγ−1 as w → 0 (S33)
and the ﬁrst non-analytic term gives the asymptotic form of the po pularity distribution from Lemmas
1 and 2:
qn ∼ Cn−γ as n → ∞ . (S34)
The prefactor of the popularity distribution power-law is explicitly re lated to the prefactor of the
degree distribution by
C = D(λz + 1)
λ
(λ(1 − µ)
µ(λz + 1)
) γ
. (S35)
• Case 3: f′′(1) ﬁnite, µ = 0
If f′′(1) is ﬁnite (so the network out-degree distribution pk has ﬁnite second moment) and µ = 0,
we expand f(1 − λ + λG) to second-order terms in the small parameter φ = 1 − G, and ﬁnd the
leading-order asymptotics of G(∞, 1 − w) to be
G(∞, 1 − w) ∼ 1 −
(
λz + 1
2 λ2f′′(1)
) − 1
2
w
1
2 as w → 0. (S36)
Using Lemmas 1 and 2, we conclude that
qn(∞) ∼ A n− 3
2 as n → ∞ , (S37)
where the prefactor is
A = ( λz + 1) [2 πλ (λf′′(1) + 2 z)]− 1
2 . (S38)
• Case 4: f′′(1) ﬁnite, 0 < µ ≪ 1
Finally, we consider the case where µ > 0 but f′′(1) is ﬁnite. In this case, G(∞, x) is analytic at
x = 1, indicating that the popularity distribution does not have a power -law tail, i.e., Lemma 1 does
not apply. However, if we write G(∞, 1 − w) = 1 − φ(w) with |φ| ≪ 1 and expand Eq. (S26) for w
near 0, retaining terms of orders w, φ and φ2, but neglecting terms of order wφ, we obtain a quadratic
equation for φ with solution
φ(w) = −µ(λz + 1) +
√
µ2(λz + 1)2 + 2λ(1 − µ)2 (λf′′(1) + 2 z) w
(1 − µ)λ (λf′′(1) + 2 z) . (S39)
Note that as µ → 0 this solution scales as φ = O
(
w
1
2
)
as w → 0, which is consistent with the choice
of retained terms in the scaling analysis of Eq. (S26). The solution (S 39) has a branch point in the
complex x-plane at (recall w = 1 − x):
α = 1 + µ2(λz + 1)2
2λ(1 − µ)2 (λf′′(1) + 2 z) > 1. (S40)
Integrating along the branch cut in the complex x-plane (in a very similar fashion to the proof of
Lemma 1) enables us to ﬁnd the large- n asymptotic form of the popularity distribution as
qn(∞) ∼ A n− 3

S4 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL, AND RELEV ANCE TO REAL NETWORKS
In deriving the branching-process theory for the model in Sec. S1 , we assume that the underlying network
is tree-like, i.e., that no loops exist. We also assume that every node f ollows (approximately) z other nodes,
so the in-degree distribution is homogeneous. Both of these assum ptions are known to be invalid for real-
world networks such as Twitter; for example, in the Spanish 15M net work[49] used in Fig. 3(c) [38, 39],
44% of all links are reciprocal links (i.e., node A follows node B and node B follows node A), whereas a
truly tree-like network would have no reciprocal links. Despite the v iolation of the assumptions used to
derive it, we ﬁnd the tree-based theory performs rather well whe n compared with numerical simulations of
the model on real-world networks (Fig. 3(c)). This ﬁnding is consist ent with the eﬀectiveness of tree-like
theory in the context of other network dynamics [40, 45] and merit s some further attention here.
Following [40, 45], we run simulations of the model on the original real-w orld network and on two rewired
versions of the network. The ﬁrst rewiring is called pjk -rewiring, as it preserves the joint distribution pjk of
in- and out-degrees in the network. To generate the pjk -rewired network, we begin by severing all links of
the original network, but allow each node to retain the same number j of “in-stubs” and k of “out-stubs”
that represent the endpoints of the deleted original edges. We th en randomly select one out-stub and
14
one in-stub and create a new edge joining the selected nodes. By re peating this procedure (each time
selecting from the set of unused out-stubs and in-stubs) we crea te a network with precisely the same ( j, k)
distribution as the original network, but with very few short cycles or loops (i.e., clustering is reduced to
the level of the corresponding directed conﬁguration-model net work [46]).
The second rewiring process we consider is called pk-rewiring: it preserves the out-degree distribution
pk of the original network, but replaces the in-degree distribution wit h a Poisson distribution. As above,
we begin by severing all links of the original network, retaining the or iginal number k of out-stubs for each
node. The edges of the new network are created by randomly selec ting an unused out-stub and creating
a directed edge from the selected out-stub to a node chosen unifo rmly at random from the N − 1 other
nodes in the network. When all rewired edges are inserted, the res ulting new network has the same out-
degree distribution pk as the original network, but has a Poisson in-degree distribution, a nd also (as for the
pjk -rewired case) has substantially fewer loops that the original netw ork (i.e. clustering is much reduced).
Figure S3(a) shows simulation results (for the popularity distributio n at age a = 10) for the original
network (blue squares), the pjk -rewired network (green triangles), and the pk-rewired network (red circles),
along with the theory (black curves). Figure S3(b) is a magniﬁcation of the low- n part of Fig. S3(a), to
highlight the diﬀerences between the various cases; Fig. S3(c) sho ws the mean popularity of age- a memes
m(a) = ∑ nqn(a) for the three networks. It is clear that the theory curves matc h very closely to the
numerical simulations on the pk-rewired network; indeed, the red symbols and black curves are alm ost
indistinguishable. This is to be expected, as the pk-rewired network satisﬁes the assumptions underlying
the derivation of our theory: the network is approximately tree-lik e, with a Poisson in-degree distribution
(for large z this is a homogeneous distribution). Focussing next on those cases where the results for the
original network deviate from the theory, it is striking that results for the pjk -rewired network are very
close to those of the original network. This implies that the diﬀerenc es observed between theory and
simulations on the original network are due chieﬂy to the in-degree d istribution being non-Poissonian,
while the eﬀect of clustering and loops—which are strongly present in the original network but absent in
the pjk -rewired case—appears to be almost negligible. Since the results on t he original network are very
similar to the results for the pjk -rewired network, it follows that a theory that incorporates infor mation
on the in-degree distribution of the network—but retains the tree -based derivation appropriate for zero-
clustering networks—should be able to closely match to the simulation results on the original (clustered)
network. The derivation of such a theory is the focus of current w ork.
S5 A MODIFIED MODEL, WITH RESTRICTED RETWEETING
A feature of the model described in the main text is that memes rema in on users’ screens even after the
user retweets the meme, and so the same user may retweet a single meme multiple times. This feature is
intended to model memes such as hashtags that may be used in multip le message sent by a single user.
However, if the memes under consideration are entire messages, t hen this feature of the model is unrealistic,
as each Twitter message is usually retweeted at most once by any sin gle user. In this section we therefore
consider a modiﬁed version of the basic model and show that criticalit y is retained in the modiﬁed model.
The numerical simulation results shown in Fig. S4 are for the same net work as used in Fig. 3(a): z-
regular out-degrees, with z = 10, and with µ = 0. However, here the model rules are altered so that each
node keeps a list of the memes it has tweeted in the past. When a node is selected to retweet, it ﬁrst
checks whether the meme on its screen has already been retweete d by it; if so, nothing happens, but if
not, retweeting occurs as usual. Figure S4 shows very similar result s to Fig. 3(a), including a power-law
popularity distribution in the inﬁnite-age limit with exponent α = 3 /2. This indicates that the criticality
mechanism is not strongly aﬀected by the modiﬁcation of the model.
Furthermore, analytical insight can be gained by considering a slight ly diﬀerent modiﬁcation of the model
rules. Here we impose the new rule that after any tweeting event th e screen of the tweeting node is set to

the “empty” state. Like the ﬁrst modiﬁcation, this rule prevents s uccessive tweets of a node being of the
same meme (though it does allow for a meme to be “‘rediscovered” by a node some time subsequent to its
ﬁrst tweeting). A consequence of this modiﬁcation is that the syst em contains a non-zero fraction of empty
screens at any time t. Taking µ = 0, λ = 1 and c = 1 for simplicity of presentation, we can obtain the
steady-state fraction i of non-empty (or “infected”) screens using the mean-ﬁeld appro ach employed in the
analysis of the two-meme case in the main text. When a retweet even t occurs, the subsequent emptying of
the tweeting node’s screen reduces the number of infected scree n by one, but the broadcast to (on average)
z followers leads to z(1 − i) previously empty screens becoming non-empty. The overall expe cted change
in the number of infected screens is thus −1 + z(1 − i), and in the dynamical equilibrium this should be
zero, yielding
i = z − 1
z . (S43)
We now consider how the outcomes listed in section S1 for a particular (non-empty) screen S1 are altered
under this modiﬁed rule. Outcome (a)—the overwriting of screen S1 by a meme tweeted by another node—
now occurs with probability zi∆ t = ( z − 1)∆ t, with the factor of i giving the probability that the tweeting
node has a non-empty screen. Outcome (c) occurs with the same p robability (∆ t) as in the original
model, but the branch on screen S1 is terminated by the emptying of the screen after tweeting, giving t he
new overall contribution of outcome (c) as ∆ t x [G(a − ∆ t, x)]k. The probability of outcome (d) is now
1 − (z i ∆ t + ∆ t) = 1 − z∆ t, and so the expression for G(k)(a, x) correct to ﬁrst order in ∆ t (and recall
µ = 0 here) is, cf. Eq. (S3):
G(k)(a, x) = ( z − 1) ∆ t  
(a)
+ ∆ t x [G(a − ∆ t, x)]k
  
(c)
+ (1 − z ∆ t)G(k)(a − ∆ t, x)  
(d)
. (S44)
In the limit ∆ t → 0, we obtain the following diﬀerential equation for G(k)(a, x), cf. Eq. (S4):
∂G(k)
∂a = z − 1 − z G(k) + x [G]k, (S45)
and multiplying by pk and summing over all k gives the following equation for G(a, x), cf. Eq. (S5):
∂G
∂a = z − 1 − z G + x f (G). (S46)
16
The popularity distributions produced by this equation are generat ed by the function H(a, x) = xf(G(a, x))
and are shown by the curves in Fig. S4; note their close resemblance to the numerical simulation results,
despite the latter being implemented using the more severe form of t he unique-retweeting rule.
Equation (S46) can be analyzed using the same methods as for Eq. ( S7), and reveals the same critical
behavior: the mean popularity of age- a memes grows linearly with age, and the old-age asymptotics of the
popularity distribution are essentially the same as the µ = 0 cases determined in Sec. S3.
