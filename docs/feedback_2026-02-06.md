## Executive Summary

You can publish on arXiv **now** without waiting for Reddit API approval by making the v1 contribution explicitly **Moltbook-first** and treating the Reddit component as a **run-scoped contextual baseline** (or appendix), not as a gating causal comparison. The only hard blockers I see are (i) **internal inconsistencies around the “4-hour” framing vs minute-scale estimated half-life**, and (ii) **multiple TODO placeholders and redactions** that will get you flagged as unfinished.

## Recommended Course of Action

**Submit an arXiv v1 within a few days as “Moltbook conversation persistence + coordination limits” with:**

1. your strongest Moltbook-only results and reproducible pipeline,
2. the *already-computed* run-scoped Reddit baseline and coarse matched comparison as **supporting context**, and
3. explicit language that matched causal inference and exposure-controlled comparisons are **future work**.

Why this is the best speed–rigor trade:

* Your Moltbook-only findings are already *publication-grade* (tree reconstruction at scale; depth tail fit µ̂; reciprocity; re-entry; survival modeling; PSD tests) and stand independently. 
* The Reddit “approval bottleneck” is not actually binding for v1 because you already have a curated, validated run-scoped dataset and matched analysis in the manuscript. 
* The biggest risk to credibility is not missing Reddit—it’s **over-claiming the 4-hour heartbeat result** and leaving visible TODOs.

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions

**Goal:** eliminate all “submission blockers” and lock a defensible v1 narrative.

1. **Make the title and abstract logically consistent with your own results**

   * Right now your empirical first-reply half-life on Moltbook is **~0.8 minutes** (primary spec) and the 4-hour periodicity test is **not significant**. 
   * That creates a high-probability desk-reject-by-readers vibe (“title doesn’t match results”).
   * Fast fix options (pick one; all are truthful):

     * **Option A (recommended):** retitle to emphasize the *clock hypothesis* rather than asserting it as fact. Example:
       *“The 4‑Hour Attention Clock Hypothesis: Conversation Half-Lives and Coordination Limits in an AI‑Agent Social Network”*
     * **Option B:** put both mechanisms in the title:
       *“The 4‑Hour Clock, Minute‑Scale Half‑Life: Conversation Persistence and Coordination Limits…”*
     * **Option C:** drop “4‑hour” entirely for v1; keep it as a tested hypothesis in H1.

2. **Remove or fill every TODO / placeholder / redaction**

   * The appendix has visible TODO tables (submolts examples; balance diagnostics; alternative estimators) and there’s a placeholder GitHub URL “[REDACTED]”. 
   * Fastest rigorous route: **delete these appendix items for v1** unless they are already auto-generated and easy to paste in.
   * Rule: if a table/figure is not (a) fully populated and (b) referenced in main claims, cut it.

3. **Clarify the estimand: what “half-life” actually measures**

   * As written, the “first-reply half-life” is estimated on *time to first direct reply to a parent comment*, with extremely heavy censoring. 
   * This is publishable, but only if you label it precisely and avoid conflating it with “thread stays alive for X hours.”
   * Add one paragraph in Methods + Results:

     * “This half-life is a **kernel decay timescale for direct replies** (staleness), not the median thread lifetime.”

4. **Lock a reproducible v1**

   * Freeze the exact run IDs already cited in the manuscript (you already name them) and treat them as canonical. 
   * Tag the repo release (e.g., `v0.1-arxiv`) and ensure the paper PDF compiles from a clean checkout with a single command.

**Deliverables for Phase 1**

* Updated `paper/main.tex` with: no TODOs, consistent title, consistent abstract.
* “Reproducibility” section updated with real repo URL (or removed for double-blind, but then remove other identifying info consistently).
* `make paper` succeeds locally; arXiv-friendly source bundle prepared.

### Phase 2: Core Analysis

**Goal:** add 2–3 small analyses that dramatically reduce reviewer attack surface, without expanding scope.

1. **Report “reply probability” separately from “reply timing” (two-part interpretation)**

   * With your hazard model, a key quantity is the probability a comment *ever* gets a direct reply in-window (related to α/β in your formulation), which is distinct from β (timing decay).
   * You currently emphasize β→half-life; that invites misinterpretation because censoring is massive. 
   * Minimal addition:

     * Report: fraction of parent comments that receive ≥1 direct reply (observed), by platform and by submolt category.
     * Report: implied “eventual reply probability” under the fitted model (even if only as a check), clearly separated from β.

2. **Replace the karma-quartile heterogeneity check (it’s weak)**

   * Your draft admits karma quartiles are uninformative because both cutoffs are 0. 
   * Fast replacements that are likely informative with existing tables:

     * `is_claimed` vs unclaimed
     * follower_count bins (e.g., 0, 1–9, 10+), or top 1% vs rest
     * “activity hubs”: top-K agents by comment count
   * Output: one short table + one figure: half-life (or reply probability) by these groups.

3. **Periodicity: keep the negative result, but harden the interpretation**

   * You already have: gap-aware PSD on longest contiguous segment; no significant 4-hour peak; dominant ~6.4h component. 
   * Add two robustness checks (cheap):

     * vary bin width (e.g., 5 min, 15 min, 30 min) and show the conclusion doesn’t flip
     * report power at 4h and at the dominant frequency with identical AR(1) calibration
   * Keep it as “evidence does not support 4h periodicity in this snapshot,” not “heartbeat doesn’t exist.”

4. **Cross-platform: keep it clean and bounded**

   * If Reddit API approval is the perceived bottleneck, your answer is: “v1 uses a run-scoped archive-based corpus; v2 will use official API when feasible.” 
   * Do **not** add more matching covariates now unless you already have them computed and can justify them.

**Deliverables for Phase 2**

* 1 table: reply probability + timing summary (Moltbook overall + by submolt; Reddit overall).
* 1 table/figure: heterogeneity by `is_claimed` or follower bins.
* 1 appendix figure: PSD robustness across bin widths (optional).

---

### Phase 3: Manuscript Completion

**Goal:** tighten narrative so the paper reads like “finished science” rather than “fast project log.”

1. **Reframe hypotheses as tests, not promises**

   * H1 currently implies a 4h periodic signature; your results do not support that at conventional thresholds. 
   * Rewrite H1 as: “We test for…” and accept “not supported in this snapshot.”

2. **Move cross-platform causal language out of the center**

   * You already say matched causal inference is future work; keep that, but ensure the abstract doesn’t sound like you’ve identified a causal effect. 
   * Recommended structure:

     * Main: Moltbook-only + model + mechanism implications
     * Secondary: Reddit baseline + coarse matched observational comparison (clearly labeled)

3. **Add a “Scope conditions” paragraph in Discussion**

   * “First-week snapshot; spam; data gaps; platform instability; heavy censoring; comparison corpus is run-scoped.”

4. **Cut appendix bloat**

   * Appendices with placeholders are worse than no appendix.
   * Keep only what’s fully reproducible and actually supports main claims.

**Deliverables for Phase 3**

* Revised abstract + intro with consistent framing.
* Clean appendix: no TODOs, no “we will later” tables.

### Phase 4: arXiv Submission

**Goal:** a clean arXiv source upload that compiles on their system.

1. **ArXiv bundle hygiene**

   * Create a dedicated `arxiv/` bundle (scripted), containing:

     * `main.tex`, included section files, `references.bib` (or compiled `main.bbl`), and all figure assets referenced.
   * Avoid:

     * spaces in filenames
     * absolute paths
     * external dependencies (minted, shell-escape) unless you know arXiv supports your exact setup.

2. **Compilation check**

   * Compile from scratch in a clean environment:

     * `make clean-paper && make paper`
   * Ensure figures are embedded correctly and fonts are included.

3. **Submission positioning**

   * Choose one primary category (likely CS/SI, CS/CY, or stat.ML depending on emphasis). The speed risk here is **endorsement** if you’re a first-time submitter in that category—handle that immediately.

4. **Versioning strategy**

   * Plan from day 0 for v2:

     * v1: minimal, defensible, Moltbook-first
     * v2: exposure-controlled periodicity + stronger cross-platform once official Reddit collection is available

**Deliverables for Phase 4**

* `arxiv_source.tar.gz` that compiles on arXiv.
* A short CHANGELOG note (“What changed since internal draft”).

## Alternative Approaches to Reddit Comparison

If you want a human baseline **without Reddit API approval**, here are viable substitutes ranked by speed-to-credible:

1. **Keep your existing run-scoped Reddit corpus (status quo)**

   * **Pros:** already implemented; already produces baseline half-life (~2.6 hours) and depth metrics; already integrated into draft. 
   * **Cons:** ToS/reproducibility sensitivities; curation caveats (dropped comments); possible criticism that it’s not “official.”

2. **Switch the human baseline to an openly licensed conversation dataset**

   * Candidates: Stack Exchange data dump, Wikipedia talk pages, GitHub issues/PR comments (public; still be mindful of ToS but generally more permissive than Reddit).
   * **Pros:** fewer ToS headaches; stable access; no approval gates.
   * **Cons:** matching to Moltbook topics is weaker; conversation tree structures differ (but you can still compare temporal decay and depth-like metrics).

3. **Use “literature baseline ranges” instead of new Reddit data**

   * Report Moltbook metrics and contextualize with known Reddit depth distributions / cascade dynamics from prior work.
   * **Pros:** fastest; avoids data use concerns entirely.
   * **Cons:** weaker comparability; reviewers will ask why you didn’t compute a same-window baseline.

4. **Do a “single-platform + mechanistic falsification” paper**

   * Drop Reddit entirely, and instead validate your model internally via:

     * submolt stratification
     * hub vs non-hub agents
     * spam vs non-spam submolts
   * **Pros:** cleanest; strongest internal validity; fastest to defend.
   * **Cons:** you lose the “human vs agent” headline.

## What to Cut or Defer

To maximize speed without sacrificing rigor, defer these to v2 or a follow-up paper:

* **Any claim of causal platform effects** (beyond “matched observational comparison under limited controls”).
* **Exposure/visibility controls** that require the 72h API feed snapshot run to be complete and symmetric across platforms.
* **Full hierarchical Hawkes / mixed-effects survival** (publishable later; not needed for v1).
* **Embedding-based topic matching** (high effort; high reviewer scrutiny).
* **Appendix sections with TODO placeholders** (delete now; reintroduce later when populated). 

## What to Emphasize Instead

To compensate for cutting Reddit-API-dependent elements, lean harder on what’s already strong:

* **Conversation geometry is extreme and clearly measured** (Moltbook max depth mean ~1.38; µ̂ ~0.154; star-shaped branching). 
* **Temporal burstiness + heavy censoring is itself a finding**, not an embarrassment. Explicitly interpret it as “rapid response if response occurs, otherwise silence.” 
* **Negative/nuanced heartbeat result**: “We do not detect a statistically significant 4-hour periodicity in this snapshot; dominant component differs.” That’s publishable. 
* **Reproducible workflow and run manifests**: this is a major credibility lever in fast-moving phenomena.

## Risk Mitigation

Likely criticisms and how to preempt them:

1. **“Your title claims 4 hours but you estimate ~1 minute.”**

   * Mitigation: retitle (Phase 1), and explicitly separate “heartbeat periodicity hypothesis” from “reply kernel half-life.” 

2. **“Your half-life is an artifact of censoring / definition.”**

   * Mitigation: report reply probability + conditional timing; add alternative persistence metric at the thread level (e.g., empirical half-life to 50% of comments). 

3. **“Periodicity test is underpowered / broken due to gaps.”**

   * Mitigation: keep the gap-aware design; show robustness across bin widths; state explicitly that better API-based continuous data is future work. 

4. **“Agent heterogeneity analysis is weak.”**

   * Mitigation: replace karma quartiles with follower_count or is_claimed splits; add a “top activity hubs” analysis. 

5. **“Reddit corpus is not official and may be incomplete.”**

   * Mitigation: label it as “run-scoped archive-based baseline,” include caveats (dropped comments, non-200s), and avoid redistributing raw data. 

6. **“Spam contaminates everything.”**

   * Mitigation: keep spam/low-signal categorization and report results with/without spam strata; if you can’t do that fast, tighten language to “early period includes spam; estimates reflect this mixture.”

## Manuscript Revisions Needed

Concrete edits I would make before arXiv v1:

1. **Title + Abstract**

   * Remove any implication that “4-hour” is empirically established.
   * Put the strongest quantitative contrasts in abstract (depth, branching, survival times), and keep causal/matched inference clearly labeled “observational; future work.” 

2. **Methods**

   * Add a boxed definition:

     * “First-reply half-life = parameter of exponential decay fit to time-to-first-direct-reply survival units.”
     * Add reply probability metric.

3. **Results**

   * Add one paragraph that interprets the minute-scale estimate and heavy censoring as a bursty two-regime process. 

4. **Appendix**

   * Delete every TODO table/section unless you can populate it from existing artifacts in <30 minutes of work. 

5. **Reproducibility**

   * Replace “[REDACTED]” repo URL with a real link or remove it if you’re not ready to share. 
   * Make Python version consistent with your repo target (your draft lists Python 3.13.5; your repo targets 3.11—pick one and justify).

## Timeline Summary

This is a **critical-path plan**, not a promise of elapsed time.

* **Day 0 (today): submission blockers**

  * Retitle + abstract consistency fix
  * Remove/fix TODOs and placeholders
  * Add explicit half-life estimand clarification
  * Clean build: `make clean-paper && make paper`
  * Freeze run IDs + tag release

* **Day 1: high-leverage robustness**

  * Add reply probability metric + (optional) conditional timing metric
  * Replace karma quartile heterogeneity with follower/is_claimed
  * PSD robustness across bin widths (optional)

* **Day 2: final polish**

  * Tighten limitations and scope language
  * Generate arXiv source bundle and test compile on clean machine
  * Submit to arXiv (v1)

* **Post-submission (v2 workstream, not gating)**

  * Finish/extend API-based continuous sampling for periodicity/exposure
  * Pursue official Reddit API (or alternative open baseline) for stronger identification

## Success Criteria

You’re ready to submit when all of the following are true:

1. **No TODO / placeholder content** remains anywhere in the PDF. 
2. **Title/abstract match the results** (especially the half-life timescale and the non-significant 4h periodicity test). 
3. Every quantitative claim in Results is traceable to a **pinned run manifest** (you already do this—keep it strict). 
4. `make paper` succeeds from a clean checkout and the **arXiv source bundle compiles**.
5. Cross-platform language is explicitly **observational** and bounded by your stated caveats (run-scoped corpus; limited overlap; missingness). 
6. The v1 story is coherent even if a reader ignores Reddit entirely: Moltbook-only + model + implications stands on its own.
