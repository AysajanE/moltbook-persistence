<overall_assessment>
The manuscript has a clear empirical “hook” (agent-only social platform, first-week snapshot) and a coherent descriptive core: Moltbook threads are shallow, root-heavy, and exhibit extremely fast “reply-or-silence” behavior. The paper’s strongest parts are (i) the crisp suite of metrics (depth, branching by depth, direct-reply incidence, half-life, reciprocity/re-entry) and (ii) the care taken to limit causal overreach in the Reddit comparison. The biggest revision needs are: (1) tighten definitions and terminology so readers cannot misread what is being estimated (especially “half-life,” “depth,” “re-entry,” “parent comments,” and “availability/heartbeat”); (2) repair a few nontrivial inconsistencies (notably H2’s re-entry claim vs. results, and the “constant hazard” language); and (3) improve mathematical rigor where the current proofs/derivations are incomplete or incorrect (most importantly the periodic-availability integral sign error and the sketch-level periodicity proposition).

<clarity_issues>

1. Undefined or weakly defined core objects (“AI agent,” “heartbeat,” “attention clock”)

* Problematic passage (p. 1–2, Intro): “Moltbook, a social network launched in January 2026 that restricts posting privileges to AI agents…” and “Moltbook agents are typically configured to check the platform at regular intervals (approximately every four hours), creating a mechanically induced ‘attention clock’…”
* Why unclear: “AI agent” can mean many things (fully autonomous, tool-using, human-in-the-loop, scripted bots, etc.). “Typically configured” is vague: configured by whom, and how uniform is the cadence? If the heartbeat is central to the title and H1, you need a reader-proof definition and a minimal evidentiary basis.
* Actionable rewrite: Add a short definitional paragraph in Section 1.1 or 4.1: define what counts as an “agent account” in the dataset, whether human steering is known/unknown, and what the “heartbeat mechanism” operationally means (e.g., “agent software polls Moltbook every ~4h to decide whether to post/comment; polling time can be jittered; cadence is not observed directly in the archive”). Also add one sentence that clarifies whether you observe heartbeat at all or only test for an aggregate periodic signature.

2. “Conversation persistence” vs. what is actually estimated (kernel decay vs. thread lifetime)

* Problematic passage (Abstract, p. 1): “conversation persistence—the temporal dynamics governing how long discussion threads remain active…” and later “reply-kernel half-lives (0.80 minutes…)”
* Why unclear: “How long threads remain active” reads like thread duration; your primary estimand is the decay rate of the direct-reply hazard to a parent comment. You do flag this later (Remark 5.1), but the abstract’s first definition contradicts the later technical meaning.
* Actionable rewrite: In the abstract, replace the persistence definition with something like: “We study *direct-reply responsiveness* via the age-decay of reply hazards (‘reply-kernel half-life’), and separately report thread durations.” If you want to keep “persistence,” explicitly define it as “hazard persistence of reply propensity.”

3. Ambiguity between “mean depth” and “mean maximum depth”

* Problematic passage (p. 12, §6.1.1): “mean depth is 1.378…” and (Abstract, p. 1): “mean maximum depth 1.378”
* Why unclear: These are not the same in standard conversation-tree literature. You are computing mean of maximum depth per thread (Dj). Calling it “mean depth” invites misinterpretation as mean node depth.
* Actionable revision: Standardize: always call Dj “maximum depth,” and report “mean maximum depth.” If you want an average node depth, define it separately (e.g., mean djn over all comments).

4. “Parent comments” is overloaded

* Problematic passage (Abstract, p. 1): “199,000 parent comments” and (p. 11, §5.2): “Using one survival unit per parent comment…”
* Why unclear: Readers may think “parent comment” means “comment that has at least one child.” You actually mean “each comment treated as a potential parent,” i.e., at-risk unit.
* Actionable rewrite: Replace “parent comment” with “candidate parent comment (at-risk unit)” on first use; then shorten to “at-risk comment” thereafter.

5. Re-entry definition excludes the root author (and that choice is not explained)

* Problematic passage (p. 8, Eq. 12): REj := #{n : ajn ∈ {aj1,…,aj,n−1}} / Nj and Table 4 footnote: “the post author is not counted separately.”
* Why unclear: Excluding the root author from participant counts and re-entry changes interpretation (especially for coordination). A reader will assume the OP is a participant by default.
* Actionable revision: Either (A) include the root author explicitly (recommended), i.e., define Aj,≤n−1 := {aj0,aj1,…,aj,n−1} and re-entry uses that set; or (B) keep your current definition but add a prominent rationale: “We treat OP-only participation as not constituting re-entry because OP is always present at depth 0; we focus on repeated *comment-level* participation.”

6. Reciprocity metric definition is underspecified

* Problematic passage (p. 10, §5.1): “Reciprocity is measured from directed dyads within threads as the fraction of dyads with bidirectional replies…”
* Why unclear: Is a dyad defined as an ordered pair of authors (replying author → parent author) aggregated over edges, or unique author pairs per thread, or per platform? Are multiple replies counted once or many times?
* Actionable revision: Add a one- or two-sentence formal definition (e.g., define edge set Ej = {(ajn, aj,pjn)}; define dyads as unique ordered pairs; bidirectional if both (u,v) and (v,u) appear in Ej). Then readers can reproduce the statistic.

7. Misleading “constant hazard” language

* Problematic passage (p. 15, §6.2.2): “γ̂ ≪ 1… deviation from a constant-hazard assumption.”
* Why unclear / incorrect framing: Your baseline is *not* constant-hazard; it is λ(s)=α e^{−β s}, which already decreases with age. So “constant hazard” is the wrong comparison class.
* Actionable rewrite: Replace with: “γ̂ ≪ 1 indicates a near-zero-time hazard spike and a much steeper early-time concentration than the exponentially decaying hazard λ(s)=α e^{−β s} can capture.”

8. Periodicity test pipeline is too compact to audit

* Problematic passage (p. 11–12, §5.3): “log(Ct+1), 24-hour moving-average detrending, and Hanning windowing… Welch… AR(1) red-noise null…”
* Why unclear: For an arXiv audience, the details matter because preprocessing can create/erase peaks. You do not specify Welch segment length/overlap, AR(1) fitting target (Ct or Yt?), and how detrending is applied at edges.
* Actionable revision: Add a short “Implementation details” subsection or an Appendix box listing: bin width, segment length, overlap %, AR(1) estimation method, number of simulations, and exact test statistic definitions. Also justify 24h detrending given a 63.5h window.

9. “Peak-to-background ratio is 6.41” is unexplained

* Problematic passage (p. 16, §6.3.1): “At the 4-hour target frequency… peak-to-background ratio is 6.41.”
* Why unclear: Background relative to what (local neighborhood mean, median, AR(1) expectation, smoothed PSD)?
* Actionable rewrite: Define it in-line: “ratio of PSD at f=0.25 to the median PSD in [f−Δ,f+Δ] excluding the bin” (or whatever you used).

10. “Arctic Shift corpus” appears without introduction

* Problematic passage (p. 12, start of §6): “Reddit full-scale baseline results from the run-scoped Arctic Shift corpus.”
* Why unclear: Section 4.2 calls it “a curated Reddit corpus” but never names “Arctic Shift.”
* Actionable revision: Either remove “Arctic Shift” entirely, or introduce it in §4.2 as the corpus name and explain provenance.

11. Minor but high-frequency LaTeX/formatting glitches reduce credibility

* Examples: “Appendix Appendix A…” (p. 3, p. 12, p. 27), “Appendix Appendix B.3…” (multiple), and odd discretionary hyphenation artifacts (“Moltbook Ob￾servatory”).
* Actionable revision: Fix the LaTeX cross-references and remove soft-hyphen/encoding artifacts before arXiv upload; these issues make readers suspicious even when the analysis is solid.
  </clarity_issues>

<coherence_and_flow>

1. Title + framing commits to a heartbeat story, but your main finding is “no 4h signature”

* Location: Title/Abstract/§1.1–1.3 vs. §6.3 and Conclusion.
* Coherence problem: The reader is primed to expect confirmation of a 4h “attention clock,” yet the paper’s main periodicity result is null. Null results are fine, but the narrative should be “testing a plausible hypothesis” rather than “explaining via heartbeat.”
* Improvement: Reframe earlier. In §1.1 and §1.2, explicitly say “we test whether a platform-level heartbeat leaves a detectable aggregate periodic signature” and note upfront that detectability is nontrivial under dephasing/jitter. Consider adjusting title to “Testing the 4-hour attention clock hypothesis…” (or similar) if you want expectations aligned.

2. The model includes b(t), but the main half-life estimator assumes b(t)=1 without a bridge argument

* Location: §3.2–3.3 vs. §5.2 (Eq. 14 → Eq. 15).
* Coherence problem: You motivate periodic availability as a key mechanism, then drop it in the likelihood. That’s not “wrong,” but it looks like an unacknowledged mismatch unless you justify scale separation (half-life minutes vs. τ hours) or say you estimate β conditional on short windows where b(t) is approximately constant.
* Improvement: Add a short paragraph in §5.2: “Because estimated half-lives are <1 minute, within-parent hazards decay on a timescale far shorter than τ≈4h; thus b(t) varies negligibly over the support of most observed replies, so setting b(t)=1 has minimal effect on β. Periodicity is instead tested at the aggregate level in §5.3.”

3. Hypotheses are bundled in ways that make interpretation awkward

* Location: §1.2 Hypotheses.
* Coherence problem: H1 combines two distinct claims (fast decay and ∼4h periodicity). The first is strongly supported; the second is not. The current structure forces you to say “H1 partially supported,” which is avoidable.
* Improvement: Split H1 into H1a (short half-life) and H1b (detectable periodic signature near 4h). Similarly, H2 currently asserts lower re-entry vs humans, which conflicts with at least one reported comparison (see Consistency).

4. The “horizon-limited cascade framework” is introduced as a theoretical backbone, but its incremental value over standard Hawkes/branching is not made explicit in the main text

* Location: §1.2 references “horizon-limited cascade framework (Section 3)” and §3.
* Coherence problem: Section 3 is largely a standard Hawkes-with-exponential-kernel plus branching interpretation, with the twist b(t). If the novelty is the platform-mechanism mapping (heartbeat + context window → b(t), β), make that mapping explicit early rather than implicit.
* Improvement: Add a short “What’s new vs. standard Hawkes/branching” paragraph at the end of §3.0 or beginning of §3.2.

5. Results section is long and metric-heavy without an early “results roadmap” paragraph

* Location: start of §6.
* Coherence problem: Readers are hit with many metrics; it’s easy to lose the narrative thread.
* Improvement: Add 5–6 sentences at the beginning of §6 summarizing the sequence: “We first establish depth/branching geometry, then estimate reply hazard decay and incidence, then test periodicity, then contextualize with Reddit and matching.”

6. Duplication of limitation content disrupts flow

* Location: §7.6 “Scope Conditions” and §8.1 “Limitations.”
* Coherence problem: §7.6 repeats most of §8.1; it reads like you weren’t sure where limitations belong.
* Improvement: Consolidate: keep the limitations in §8 only, and in §7.6 either delete entirely or replace with a brief “Interpretation guardrails” paragraph pointing to §8.

7. Matched comparison is presented as a major pillar in the Results and Appendix, but its interpretive status remains ambiguous

* Location: §6.5, Table 8, Figures 13–15, §7.5.
* Coherence problem: You correctly caution it’s observational and overlap-only, yet you also devote substantial space and make it sound like a core contribution.
* Improvement: Either (A) elevate it as a clear “secondary analysis” with a one-paragraph justification and explicit role (“context only”), or (B) move most details/figures to the appendix and keep only Table 8 + one paragraph in the main text.
  </coherence_and_flow>

<consistency_issues>

1. H2 (“lower re-entry”) conflicts with your own overall descriptive stats

* Conflicting statements:

  * Hypothesis (p. 2, §1.2): “H2 posits… lower reciprocity and re-entry.”
  * Results: Moltbook re-entry mean 0.195 (p. 12, §6.1.3 / Table 4) vs Reddit re-entry mean 0.0938 (p. 17, §6.4.1).
* Nature of inconsistency: The reported overall Moltbook re-entry is higher than Reddit’s, contradicting “lower re-entry.” In matched sample, Moltbook re-entry is lower (Table 8), but H2 did not specify “after matching” or “conditional on size.”
* Resolution: Revise H2 to focus on reciprocity and depth (supported), and either drop the re-entry directional claim or qualify it (“re-entry is limited and may differ by conditioning on thread size/overlap strata”). Also consider plotting re-entry vs thread size for both platforms to reconcile.

2. “Mean depth” terminology is inconsistent

* Conflicting usage: Abstract uses “mean maximum depth,” while §6.1.1 uses “mean depth” for the same statistic.
* Resolution: Use “mean maximum depth” everywhere; reserve “mean node depth” for a distinct metric if added.

3. “Constant hazard” phrasing contradicts your actual baseline hazard model

* Conflicting statements: §6.2.2 implies your baseline assumes constant hazard, but §5.2 explicitly models hazard λ(s)=α e^{−β s}.
* Resolution: Fix language (see clarity issue #7).

4. Dataset naming inconsistency (“curated Reddit corpus” vs “Arctic Shift corpus”)

* Conflicting statements: §4.2 names the corpus descriptively; §6 introduces “Arctic Shift corpus.”
* Resolution: Pick one name; define it once; use it consistently.

5. Paper organization statement doesn’t match the actual appendix structure

* Conflicting statements: (p. 3, §1.5) “Appendix Appendix A…” suggests only Appendix A is relevant, but you have Appendix B with proofs/derivations and model extensions (pp. 28–30).
* Resolution: Update §1.5 to mention Appendix B explicitly (and fix the “Appendix Appendix” LaTeX bug).

6. Internal consistency around “µ̂” as an estimand

* Tension: You estimate µ̂ by fitting log P(D≥k) using Proposition 3.11, but Proposition 3.11 is an upper bound (≤), not an equality. Later you treat µ̂ as an effective reproduction parameter (p. 10–12).
* Resolution: Either (A) explicitly relabel µ̂ as “effective tail-slope parameter” and present it as descriptive, or (B) add a justification/approximation statement: in subcritical GW with light-tailed offspring, P(D≥k) ≈ c µ^k for moderate k; then µ̂ estimates the exponential rate. Also cross-check µ with mean non-root children directly.

7. Matched-subset half-life differs substantially from overall half-life without explanation

* Conflicting presentation: Overall half-life 0.80 minutes (p. 12–14), matched-subset half-life 3.77 minutes (p. 19).
* Resolution: Add one sentence: matched subset has far fewer events (22) and selects a narrow overlap region; the estimate is noisy and not directly comparable.

8. A mathematical derivation in Appendix B has a sign error (see Mathematical Review)

* Consequence: Even if it cancels under phase averaging, the presence of an error in the appendix undermines confidence in the theoretical part.
* Resolution: Correct the integral identity and the resulting expression (details below).
  </consistency_issues>

<structural_recommendations>

1. Split H1 into two hypotheses and mirror that split in Results and Discussion

* Move/split: Replace H1 with H1a (short hazard half-life) and H1b (detectable 4-hour periodic signature).
* Rationale: Avoid “partial support” ambiguity; improves logical mapping of tests to hypotheses.
* Expected improvement: Cleaner narrative and less reader confusion about what “the hypothesis” was.

2. Add a “Definitions & estimands” mini-subsection at the end of the Introduction or beginning of Methods

* Add: A short boxed list defining: (i) maximum depth Dj, (ii) direct-reply incidence, (iii) re-entry REj (with/without root), (iv) reply-kernel half-life h=ln2/β, (v) what “parent comment” means.
* Rationale: Many readers will not know “submolt,” may misread “depth,” and will misinterpret “half-life.”
* Expected improvement: Reduces repeated clarifications later (e.g., Remark 5.1).

3. Reorganize Section 3 so “Summary of predictions” is not an orphan header

* Issue: §3.9 “Summary of Model Predictions” appears without narrative; Table 2 is doing the work but feels visually detached.
* Change: Place Table 2 immediately under §3.9 with a short paragraph that explicitly maps each prediction to a later section (“P1 tested in §6.2,” etc.).
* Expected improvement: Better signposting; readers see how the model earns its keep.

4. Consolidate limitations: merge §7.6 into §8 (or delete §7.6)

* Move/merge: If you want “Scope Conditions,” make it the opening paragraph of §8.1 and remove the duplication.
* Rationale: Avoid repeating the same caveats twice.
* Expected improvement: Tighter Discussion; cleaner separation between interpretation and limitations/ethics.

5. Decide what role the Reddit comparison plays and structure accordingly
   Option A (secondary context, recommended given the paper’s Moltbook-first claim):

* Move: Put most of §6.5 (matching details, multiple diagnostics figures) into Appendix; keep Table 8 + one paragraph in main.
* Rationale: Preserves focus on Moltbook while still giving context.
  Option B (major contribution):
* Add: A short “Why this comparison” paragraph at the end of §1.4 and a stronger methodological rationale in §5.4.
* Rationale: If it’s core, it needs stronger motivation and clearer boundaries.

6. Put the “two-regime” finding into the main Results summary as a headline

* Change: In §6.2.1, elevate the decomposition (incidence vs timing) to a named result: “Result: a low-incidence / ultra-fast conditional response regime.”
* Rationale: This is one of your most interesting empirical insights and should not be buried after parameter estimates.
* Expected improvement: Stronger storyline and clearer contribution beyond a single half-life number.

7. Fix LaTeX cross-reference and naming inconsistencies systematically

* Move/merge: Not structural per se, but do this as a “pre-arXiv production pass.”
* Expected improvement: Professional polish; prevents readers from discounting the work due to formatting noise.
  </structural_recommendations>

<mathematical_review>
Below I list the formal claims/propositions and the main mathematical issues, then provide corrected/improved proofs and derivations where needed.

A) Proposition 3.7 (Influence–persistence trade-off) — proof can be made exact and cleaner

* Current statement (p. 7, Prop 3.7): “Expected replies are increasing in influence (αi) and decreasing in staleness decay (βi).”
* Current proof (p. 28, Appendix B.1.1) uses the approximation µi ≈ αi/βi, which is unnecessary and slightly weakens rigor because µi(s) in Eq. (7) depends on b(s+u).
* Improved proof (exact, no approximation):
  Let b(t)≥0 for all t and define
  µi(s)=∫_0^∞ b(s+u) αi e^{−βi u} du.
  Then
  ∂µi(s)/∂αi = ∫_0^∞ b(s+u) e^{−βi u} du > 0
  since the integrand is nonnegative and not identically zero under any nontrivial activity.
  Also
  ∂µi(s)/∂βi = ∫_0^∞ b(s+u) αi (−u) e^{−βi u} du < 0
  because αi>0, u>0 on (0,∞), and b(s+u)≥0.
  Therefore µi(s) is strictly increasing in αi and strictly decreasing in βi for any fixed s. □
* Actionable revision: Replace Appendix B.1.1 with this proof, and optionally note that the phase-averaged approximation yields µi≈αi/βi when b has mean 1.

B) Proposition 3.9 (Expected comment count with root-special branching) — mostly OK but add assumptions and clarify counting

* Current: You give an expectation argument (Appendix B.1.2) consistent with a two-type Galton–Watson model.
* Needed clarifications:

  1. Specify whether Nj counts comments excluding the root (your notation suggests yes: Nj is number of comments).
  2. Explicitly state independence and identical distribution assumptions for offspring counts of non-root nodes, or label it as “heuristic approximation.”
* Minimal fix: Add one sentence before Prop 3.9: “Assume offspring counts for non-root comments are i.i.d. with mean µ and finite expectation, independent across nodes, and independent of the root’s offspring count X0.”

C) Proposition 3.11 (Depth tail bound) — correct but missing definition of Zk and the inequality-vs-estimation issue

* Current: “P(Dj ≥ k) ≤ E[Zk] = µ^k.” Proof via Markov is fine.
* Missing: Define Zk explicitly in the proposition statement (“Zk is the number of nodes at depth k”).
* Bigger issue: In §5.1 you fit µ̂ by least squares on log P(D≥k) using Prop 3.11. But the proposition is an upper bound, not equality.
* Actionable revision:

  * Either relabel: “We estimate an effective tail-slope parameter µ̂ by fitting log P(D≥k) ≈ c + k log µ over k≥2; this is motivated by the GW bound P(D≥k) ≤ µ^k and by the empirical near-linearity of log-tails.”
  * Or provide a justification: In subcritical GW with light-tailed offspring, P(Zk>0) decays approximately geometrically at rate close to µ; then µ̂ is an approximation to the true reproduction mean.

D) Proposition 3.13 (Periodicity signatures) — currently only a sketch; needs a correct, explicit statement

* Current (p. 7–8): “If b(t) has period τ, aggregated activity implied by the model exhibits spectral concentration at frequency 1/τ and harmonics.” Proof sketch in Appendix B.1.3 references Fourier series and “second-order structure” without specifying stationarity/cyclostationarity assumptions.

* Why this matters: A Hawkes process with periodic modulation is generally not stationary; its second-order structure is cyclostationary. “PSD” needs careful definition (ordinary stationary PSD vs. cyclic spectra). Your empirical method uses a stationary-PSD style approach (Welch on detrended log counts), so the proposition should be framed in the language you actually use: “periodic modulation implies a periodic mean intensity and thus peaks in the periodogram/PSD estimate of aggregate counts.”

* A more rigorous, implementable proposition (suggested replacement):
  Proposition 3.13′ (Periodic mean intensity implies periodogram peaks).
  Suppose the aggregate count process N(t) is a (possibly self-exciting) point process observed over a long window, with conditional intensity of the form λ(t)=b(t)·g(t), where b(t) is deterministic, bounded, and τ-periodic, and g(t) is a nonnegative adapted process such that E[g(t)] exists and is finite for all t. Then the mean intensity m(t):=E[λ(t)] is τ-periodic, and the expected value of standard PSD/periodogram estimates of binned counts exhibits elevated power at frequencies ℓ/τ (ℓ∈ℤ), up to leakage and finite-sample effects.

  Proof (sketch but more explicit than current):
  Since b(t) is deterministic, m(t)=E[λ(t)]=b(t)E[g(t)]. If E[g(t)] is τ-periodic or approximately constant relative to τ (as in your motivation when kernel half-lives are minutes and τ is hours), then m(t) inherits τ-periodicity. For binned counts Ct over bins of width Δ, E[Ct]≈∫_{tΔ}^{(t+1)Δ} m(s) ds, which is also approximately τ-periodic. A discrete-time periodic mean produces spectral lines (or concentrated power) at integer multiples of 1/τ in the Fourier transform of the mean function, and finite-sample periodogram/PSD estimators detect this as peaks near ℓ/τ. □

* Actionable revision: Either (i) adopt this proposition (and be explicit that you’re talking about detectability in periodograms/PSD of binned counts), or (ii) keep the existing proposition but add a paragraph acknowledging cyclostationarity and explaining why the empirical PSD heuristic is expected to detect periodic mean modulation.

E) Appendix B.2.1 has a sign error in the cosine integral (this is a real mathematical bug)

* Location: p. 28, Appendix B.2.1: “Using ∫_0^∞ e^{−βu} cos(ωu+θ) du = (β cos θ + ω sin θ)/(β^2+ω^2) …” and Eq. (18) accordingly uses “+ ω sin(ωs+ϕ)”.
* Correct identity:
  ∫_0^∞ e^{−βu} cos(ωu+θ) du = (β cos θ − ω sin θ)/(β^2+ω^2), for β>0.
* Corrected Eq. (18):
  µi(s)= αi/βi [ 1 + κ βi (βi cos(ωs+ϕ) − ω sin(ωs+ϕ)) / (βi^2+ω^2) ].
* Note: Your phase-averaged result µi≈αi/βi remains true because the sine/cosine terms integrate to zero over s, but you should still correct the derivation to avoid an obvious error.

F) Survival model interpretation: the “Exponential(β)” conditional approximation should be stated with its condition

* Location: p. 14, model check paragraph: “conditional distribution … is approximately Exponential(β̂).”
* This is true in the “rare-event” regime where α/β is small (you note α/β≈0.097), but should be stated explicitly as an approximation, not an identity.
* Actionable revision: Insert “when α/β ≪ 1” in the sentence and consider adding the exact conditional density expression (one line) in an appendix:
  f(s | event) = [α e^{−β s} exp(−(α/β)(1−e^{−β s}))] / [1−exp(−α/β)].

G) Notational collision: T used for both “tree” (Tj) and time normalization window (Definition 3.1)

* Location: p. 5, §3.1 vs §3.2.
* Actionable revision: Rename the normalization horizon to L (or W) to avoid confusion.
  </mathematical_review>

<focus_and_scope>

1. Tighten the “heartbeat” storyline

* What to condense: Repeated references implying heartbeat is the driver when you do not detect a 4-hour peak (Abstract + Intro + Discussion).
* What to add: One short paragraph on detectability limits: dephasing/jitter across agents, mixture of cadences, and the short contiguous observation window. This makes the null result feel informative rather than anticlimactic.

2. Consider moving most of the matched cross-platform comparison to an appendix

* Rationale: The Moltbook-first contribution is strong on its own. The matched comparison is useful context but currently consumes substantial space and may distract from the agent-platform story—especially since only 2.34% of Moltbook threads are matchable (p. 18).
* Minimal main-text version: Keep Table 8 + one paragraph summarizing “overlap-region” results; move the balance figures and flow figure to Appendix.

3. Expand the “two-regime” phenomenon into a central conceptual result

* What to expand: Currently the “fast response or silence” insight appears as an interpretation of heavy censoring plus ultra-fast conditional reply times (p. 13–14).
* Add: A short “incidence vs timing” subsection or boxed result early in §6.2, explicitly stating: “pobs is low; conditional replies occur within seconds; simple exponential hazard is a coarse timescale.” This is likely to be what readers remember.

4. Reduce numerical precision throughout

* What to condense: Many estimates are reported with excessive decimals (e.g., γ̂ = 0.1115 with CI width 0.0012).
* Recommendation: Round to 2–3 significant digits unless there is a reason not to. Precision inflation hurts readability and sometimes credibility.

5. Clarify what you do with missing author IDs and whether they affect key network metrics

* What to expand: Table 4 notes threads where all commenter agent_id values are null record zero unique agents.
* Why it matters: Missingness can mechanically deflate reciprocity/re-entry/participant counts.
* Add: A short sensitivity note: recompute key interaction metrics on the subset with fully observed agent IDs, or explicitly state how missing values are handled in dyads and re-entry.
  </focus_and_scope>

<actionable_revisions>
High priority (do these before anything else)

1. Fix the mathematical error in Appendix B.2.1 (cosine integral sign) and update Eq. (18).
2. Repair hypothesis structure and mapping:

   * Split H1 into H1a (short half-life) and H1b (4h periodicity detectable).
   * Revise H2 to remove or qualify the directional “lower re-entry” claim (or condition it explicitly), since overall re-entry appears higher on Moltbook than Reddit.
3. Eliminate terminology ambiguities:

   * Replace “mean depth” with “mean maximum depth” wherever Dj is used.
   * Replace “parent comments” with “at-risk comments (candidate parents)” in the survival context.
   * Define “submolt,” “claimed account,” and “heartbeat” operationally on first use.
4. Fix the “constant hazard” phrasing in §6.2.2; rewrite to compare Weibull behavior to your exponentially decaying hazard model, not to a constant hazard.
5. Address the b(t) vs b(t)=1 mismatch explicitly in §5.2 (scale-separation justification) so the model/estimation story is internally coherent.
6. Run a LaTeX/encoding cleanup pass: remove “Appendix Appendix …” bugs and soft-hyphen artifacts; ensure cross-references match the actual structure.

Medium priority (material improvements to readability and logical flow)
7) Add a short “Definitions & estimands” box (end of §1 or start of §5) that defines the key metrics and what they are/are not.
8) Add a roadmap paragraph at the start of §6 and elevate the “two-regime” finding as a named result.
9) Expand periodicity methods details enough to audit (Welch settings, AR(1) fitting target, detrending edge handling).
10) Explain the appearance of the 6.4h dominant period as potentially a resolution/binning/window artifact (or at least note frequency resolution limitations).
11) Clarify handling of the 41.72h coverage gap for survival units and duration metrics (what censoring boundary applies to comments near the gap).

Low priority (polish and optional strengthening)
12) Reduce numerical precision globally to improve readability.
13) Consider adding one additional sensitivity plot: re-entry (and/or reciprocity) vs thread size for both platforms to reconcile conflicting impressions.
14) Decide whether the matched comparison is “secondary context” or “core contribution,” then either compress it (appendix) or motivate it more strongly (intro + methods).
15) Consider renaming “interaction half-life” to “direct-reply hazard half-life” (or similar) to prevent reader misinterpretation.

<additional_comments>

* Figure captions: Several captions are fine, but a few would benefit from explicitly stating whether they use threads-with-≥1-comment only, and whether root posts are included/excluded (e.g., Figure 1 and the depth distribution). Small clarifications prevent misreadings.
* Internal consistency check you should do once: create a one-page “metric glossary” and verify every place each metric is mentioned matches that glossary. Right now, the manuscript is very close, but the “depth” naming and “parent comment” phrasing are sources of avoidable confusion.
* The manuscript’s strongest interpretive line is not the 4-hour signature (null), but the *minute-scale decay + ultra-fast conditional replies + shallow non-root branching*. If you want the paper to land, keep steering the narrative toward “coordination horizons are limited because the conversation kernel collapses almost immediately,” and treat heartbeat as a plausible mechanism you tested (and did not detect at aggregate scale in this window).
