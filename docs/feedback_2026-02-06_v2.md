### Meta-Block

* **Scope:** arXiv-readiness review of *main_arxiv.pdf* with emphasis on (i) modeling/methods alignment with what you actually estimated, (ii) arXiv-grade writing/structure, and (iii) critical pre-submission fixes. 
* **Confidence score:** 0.84 (high on internal-consistency, “cut vs keep,” and presentation issues; medium on statistical adequacy where I’d need to inspect code + raw distributions).
* **Perspective:** publication-first but hostile-reader calibrated: keep only what you can defend quickly and unambiguously; anything that smells like “model theater” or pipeline notes should be removed or demoted.

## Bottom line: you’re close, but not “submission-clean” yet

I’d call this **~90% arXiv-ready**. The core story is now coherent: Moltbook-first results are strong; Reddit is clearly secondary; the 4-hour claim is appropriately framed as a tested hypothesis with a negative result.

But there are **several must-fix issues** that would reliably trigger skepticism from careful readers:

### Must-fix before arXiv (high probability of being criticized)

1. **Remove “pipeline artifact” prose inside Results** (file paths, “promoted artifacts,” etc.). This reads like an internal build log, not a paper.

   * Example: the lines in Section **6.4** that list “Promoted artifacts for this subsection are … figures/… .png” (page ~24) should be cut or moved to Reproducibility.
   * Same problem in **6.5** (“promoted table…”, “machine-readable results are promoted to…” on page ~26).

2. **Fix the “three subreddits” vs “six subreddits” inconsistency.**

   * You explicitly list **six** subreddits in **4.2.1** (page ~13–14).
   * Later you describe the Reddit corpus as “three subreddits” in the **Scope Conditions** paragraph (page ~32).
     This is exactly the kind of sloppiness that makes readers doubt the rest.

3. **Your branching-process section currently looks mathematically inconsistent with your own descriptive stats unless you clarify “root is special.”**

   * You report a very high **root branching** (~5.57) and mean **comments per post** ~6.43 (Table 4; page ~13).
   * Yet the single-type branching formula in Section 3.5 (and the way µ̂ is introduced) can be read as implying very small expected total size when µ̂ is 0.154.
     The fix is simple and actually strengthens the paper: explicitly model a **two-type process** (root vs non-root). More on this below.

4. **The half-life / timing decomposition table looks internally inconsistent with the stated hazard model—verify and fix.**

   * Under your stated model, when reply probability is small (which it is on Moltbook), the **conditional median time-to-first-reply** should be close to the **kernel half-life**.
   * But Table 5 reports **half-life ≈ 0.80 minutes** and **conditional median ≈ 0.076 minutes** (page ~22), a ~10× gap. That’s a red flag: either the conditional-median calculation is not what the text claims, units are off, or the model fit is not what you think it is.
     You can either (a) correct the computation/units, or (b) explicitly state that the exponential-kernel model is a coarse summary and does **not** capture conditional timing well—and then stop using the model to compute implied probabilities as if it did. Right now it’s in a credibility “uncanny valley.”

5. **Table 4 shows “Unique agents per thread” minimum = 0 for threads that (by definition) have ≥1 comment** (page ~13).
   That’s either a definition issue (“unique agents with resolvable agent_id”) or a bug. Either way, you need to fix/clarify it because it undermines the data integrity story you otherwise tell well.

---

## 1) Modeling & methodology: what to cut, what to keep, what to repair

### 1.1 The model is currently “larger than the empirics”

The core model pieces that you actually operationalize well:

* **Direct-reply staleness kernel** (α, β) → half-life (Section 5.2 + Results 6.2)
* **Conversation geometry**: depth, branching-by-depth, reciprocity, re-entry (Section 5.1 + Results 6.1)
* **Periodicity tests** on aggregated activity (Section 5.3 + Results 6.3)
* **Coarse matching** (Section 5.4 + Results 6.5) clearly framed as observational

The parts that look like you’re promising more than you deliver (high attack surface for no v1 payoff):

* **Section 3.4 thread-level effective half-life** (Eq. 7) — you never use it empirically.
* **Section 3.6 hierarchical random-effects model** (Eq. 13) — you explicitly say you didn’t fit mixed-effects, only stratified pooled summaries (Section 5.2.3).
* **Section 3.6.2–3.6.3 re-entry Hawkes-like intensity + parent-selection weights** (Eqs. 14–16) — also not estimated, and the “UI weights” discussion invites the obvious question: *“did you estimate w?”* (no).
* **Proposition 3.14 item (2)** about “mass near τ and its multiples” — you don’t actually test the inter-comment-time spikes/multiples claim; you test PSD and autocorrelation. Either add the test or delete that prediction.

**Recommendation (publication-grade simplification):**

* Keep Sections **3.1–3.5** (but repair them; see next subsection).
* Move **3.6** (and any UI-weight talk) into either:

  * an “Extensions” subsection at the end of Section 3 with explicit disclaimer (“not estimated in this manuscript”), **or**
  * the Appendix.
* Drop Eq. (7) unless you add an empirical thread-level βj/hj analysis.

This is not about “math is bad”; it’s about **identification and congruence**. Every unestimated parameter is an invitation for reviewers to say “hand-wavy.”

### 1.2 Repair the branching-process story: make root special and you get a win

Right now, a careful reader can get stuck on: “If µ̂ = 0.154, how do you get ~6.4 comments per post?” This is fixable **and** becomes one of your strongest “model fits reality” moments.

**What to do (minimal change, high leverage):**

* Define a **root offspring mean** µ₀ (expected number of direct replies to the root post).
* Define µ as the **non-root reproduction mean** (expected number of direct replies to a *comment*).
* Then expected total comments becomes approximately:

  * **E[comments] ≈ µ₀ / (1 − µ)** (for a two-type “root then subcritical cascade” approximation).

You already empirically estimate both:

* µ₀ ≈ **5.57** (root mean direct replies; Results 6.1.2)
* µ ≈ **0.154** (your fitted tail parameter; Results 6.1.1)

Plugging those in yields ≈ 5.57 / (1−0.154) ≈ 6.6 comments per post — remarkably close to Table 4 mean 6.43. That’s a **clean internal consistency check** you should absolutely exploit.

**Concrete edits:**

* In Section **3.5.2**, replace the single-type expected size proposition with a short two-type remark and formula.
* In Results **6.1**, add one sentence:

  * “A two-type approximation with µ₀ equal to the observed root branching factor and µ equal to the fitted depth-tail parameter predicts mean comments per post near the observed 6.43.”

This simultaneously:

* defuses the “your branching math doesn’t match your descriptives” critique, and
* gives you a model-validation nugget without adding analyses.

---

### 1.3 Clarify µ̂ estimation and conditioning (threads with ≥1 comment)

You estimate depth distribution **conditional on threads that have at least one comment** (N=34,730). But the branching-process tail bound is naturally stated for the unconditional process (including empty cascades).

**Fix:**

* State explicitly in Methods 5.1.1:

  * whether you fit the tail starting at k≥2 (which avoids the “P(D≥1)=1” conditioning issue),
  * and that µ̂ should be interpreted as an **effective non-root reproduction parameter** rather than a literal offspring mean for the root.

Right now, it reads like you’re applying a clean theorem to a conditioned dataset without acknowledging the conditioning. That’s a classic “hostile reader” target.

---

### 1.4 The half-life estimand is clarified well—now make it un-misreadable

Remark 5.1 is good. Still, the term “half-life” is so loaded that many will misread it.

**Two concrete improvements:**

1. Rename throughout:

   * “first-reply half-life” → **“reply-kernel half-life”** or **“hazard half-life”** (same number, less confusion).
2. Replace/augment Figure 4 (KM curve) with something that visually expresses the estimand:

   * Plot empirical **reply rate vs parent age** (binned hazard estimate) on a log scale, overlay the fitted exponential-kernel decay.
     The current KM curve (Figure 4) is easy to misunderstand because the survival curve plateaus near ~0.91 due to non-reply mass, and the “half-life” is not a survival half-life.

---

### 1.5 The “conditional median time” inconsistency needs a hard check

This is the biggest methodological red flag in the current draft because it looks like either a computation bug or a definitional mismatch.

**What I would do immediately:**

* Add a one-line model-check in Methods 5.2.3 or Results 6.2:

  * compute the **model-implied conditional median** given (α̂, β̂) and report it next to the empirical conditional median.
* If they don’t match, you have two options:

  * **Option A (preferred):** fix the empirical computation/units so it matches the stated definition (median time-to-first-direct-reply *for parents with ≥1 reply*).
  * **Option B:** admit the exponential-kernel is a coarse fit that captures overall decay but not conditional timing, and **stop calling the conditional timing “consistent with the fitted exponential decay”** (don’t imply that).

Right now, the table and the model text are not “obviously consistent,” and that’s dangerous at arXiv because smart readers will email/tweet about it.

---

### 1.6 Appendix A.1.2 currently conflicts with your stated “one survival unit per parent”

Appendix A.1.2 derives a likelihood using **K reply times per parent** (page ~41), which is the full inhomogeneous Poisson-process likelihood, not a first-event survival likelihood.

But in Results 6.2 you clearly treat it as:

* 199,000 parents
* 17,915 events
* 181,085 censored
  This is a binary-event-per-parent framing (first reply only).

**Fix:** rewrite A.1.2 to match the first-event likelihood (your Eq. 20), or explicitly state you fit the full-process likelihood (and then report K totals etc). Don’t leave this ambiguous.

---

## 2) Writing & presentation: align with high-quality arXiv norms

### 2.1 Remove “build system” language from the narrative

High-quality arXiv papers almost never include:

* “promoted artifacts are…”
* raw file paths to generated PNGs/CSVs
* internal run IDs in Results prose

**Where to keep run IDs and file paths:**

* Section 9 Reproducibility (you already do this well).
* Optional: a footnote like “All figures generated by script X; run manifest in repo” (but not lists of filenames).

**Where not to keep them:**

* Results section body.

This is a pure presentation fix, but it has outsized credibility impact.

---

### 2.2 Abstract: it’s strong, but you can tighten and de-risk

Your abstract already does the key “arXiv thing”: clear dataset, clear metrics, clear negative result.

But I’d do three edits:

1. **Fix the “shortest submolt” claim.**
   As written, “Social/Casual shortest (0.01 hr)” is not literally true if Creative is 0.0076 hr. Either change to “Creative and Social/Casual are shortest” or qualify “among high-volume categories.”

2. **Reduce unit whiplash.**
   You report half-life in minutes and submolt half-life in hours. Pick one primary unit and convert consistently. For a general reader, “0.80 minutes” + “8.1 minutes” is clearer than “0.13 hr”.

3. **De-emphasize “4-hour” as an established mechanism.**
   Even with “hypothesis” framing, leading with “4-hour” can sound like you’re pushing a result you didn’t find. You partially fix this by explicitly stating non-significance. Consider making the negative result earlier in the abstract to preempt misreaders.

---

### 2.3 Introduction: good structure; add a sharper “what we found” paragraph early

Your introduction is already organized (Motivation → Questions → Hypotheses → Contributions). What it’s missing is a **one-paragraph “preview of results”** that is distinct from the abstract and uses fewer numbers.

A typical arXiv pattern is:

* **Paragraph 1:** Why this matters.
* **Paragraph 2:** What you did + what you found (high level).
* Then drill into questions/hypotheses.

I’d add a short preview paragraph around the end of 1.1 or start of 1.3:

* “In this first-week snapshot, we find star-shaped trees, low direct reply incidence, minute-scale reply-kernel half-life, and no statistically significant 4h spectral peak; Reddit baseline shows materially longer persistence. These patterns imply …”

This improves skim-readability dramatically.

---

### 2.4 Add a real Conclusion section

Right now the paper ends with Reproducibility + Appendix. You have a Discussion and Scope Conditions, but no “Conclusion” that gives the 5 takeaways and the disciplined future-work boundary.

For arXiv, a **short** conclusion (½–1 page) is worth it:

* 3–5 bullet “what we learned”
* 2 bullet “what we did not establish”
* 2 bullet “what v2 will do when continuous/exposure-controlled data exists”

This will reduce misinterpretation and makes the paper easier to cite.

---

### 2.5 Figures: fix the “wrong scale” problem for the survival result

A minute-scale phenomenon plotted on an hours-scale axis invites misunderstanding.

**Concrete figure suggestions (minimal effort):**

* Replace Figure 4 with:

  * a zoomed-in time axis (e.g., first 10 minutes) **and** a second panel/appendix showing the long tail, or
  * a binned hazard plot of reply probability per unit time vs parent age (log y-axis).
* For Table 5, consider reporting conditional median in **seconds** for Moltbook if it’s truly that small. Right now “0.076 minutes” forces mental math.

---

## 3) Section-by-section comments beyond Methods/Model

### 3.1 Data section: the gap caveat needs one more sentence for survival/duration

You correctly flag a 41.72-hour gap and restrict periodicity to contiguous segments (Section 4.1.3 + 5.3). But a skeptical reader will ask:

> Does the gap also bias thread duration and reply hazard estimates?

You should add a sentence in Methods or Limitations stating whether you:

* exclude parent comments whose potential reply window crosses the gap, **or**
* treat this as a limitation that could undercount replies and shorten measured durations.

Right now it reads like “gap matters for PSD but not for survival,” which is not obviously true.

---

### 3.2 Periodicity: reconcile “no 4h peak” with positive 4h autocorrelation

You report:

* PSD test not significant at 4h (p≈0.50),
* but agent-level lag-4h autocorrelation is positive and tightly estimated (mean ≈0.11).

That can be totally coherent (phase jitter can kill aggregated spectral peaks). But you need to **interpret it** in one paragraph so readers don’t think you contradicted yourself.

A good line:

* “Lag-4h autocorrelation reflects short-lag persistence and does not uniquely identify a 4h periodic driver; nonetheless it is consistent with weak or dephased heartbeat behavior that is not strong enough to yield a significant aggregate spectral peak in this short contiguous window.”

Right now it’s “reported but unexplained.”

---

### 3.3 Cross-platform comparison: you’re mostly disciplined—keep it that way

You do a good job saying “associative, not causal.” Two further improvements:

1. **Stop repeating exact p-values in prose** unless necessary.
   It reads like “significance theater.” A table is enough.

2. Be explicit about external validity:

   * “Only 2.34% of Moltbook threads are matched; estimates describe the overlap region.”

You already basically say this in limitations; bring it forward in 6.5 as one sentence.

---

### 3.4 Reproducibility: fix the Python version mismatch (or explain it more cleanly)

You currently say:

* canonical runs used Python 3.13.5,
* repo targets 3.11.

This is a credibility footgun because readers will assume “I can’t reproduce.” Easiest fix:

* re-run canonical analyses on 3.11 (or 3.12) and state that as canonical.

If you can’t do that, provide a Docker/uv lockfile and say: “Canonical results were produced in a pinned environment; see container spec.” But don’t leave “3.13.5 vs 3.11” hanging.

---

## 4) A prioritized punch-list for your next revision

### A. Do these before you touch anything else

* Delete “promoted artifacts / file path” prose in Results (6.4, 6.5).
* Fix the “three vs six subreddits” inconsistency.
* Fix or clarify Table 4 unique-agents min=0.
* Resolve the Table 5 conditional-median vs half-life inconsistency (definition/units/model check).
* Repair branching-process section to treat root as special (and add the nice size-consistency check).

### B. High value, low effort (strongly recommended)

* Rename “Exponential model” → “Exponential-kernel hazard model” (or similar) to avoid confusion with constant-hazard exponential survival.
* Add a short Conclusion section.
* Make the survival figure match the timescale (zoom/hazard plot).
* Add 1–2 sentences about whether the timestamp gap can affect survival/duration.

### C. Optional (only if you have time and it’s already computed)

* Add a simple inter-comment-time “multiples of 4h” check if you want to keep Proposition 3.14(2). Otherwise delete that claim.

---

If you implement the Must-fix set + the “root-special branching repair,” I’d consider this **ready to post to arXiv** without embarrassment and with a story that survives hostile reading.
